<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>PART I:
FORTUNE</h2>
<h3><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>I</h3>
<p>It was dusk of an April day, and Fifth Avenue was
crowded.&nbsp; A young man, who had emerged from a large hotel,
stood in the stream of traffic and gazed irresolutely up and down
the thoroughfare.&nbsp; He wore a long, cheap rain-coat, and his
head was covered by a steamer-cap of an old design, with two
flaps tied in a knot across the top, behind which an overabundant
crop of dull black hair pushed forth.</p>
<p>His thin, sallow face was unshaven, and his eyes were rimmed
by round steel spectacles that gave him an almost owlish
expression.&nbsp; An air of dejection hung about him, as he
loitered by the curb&mdash;not the imaginative depression of
youth, soon to float off like a cloud before the sun of life, but
rather the settled gloom of repeated failure, as if the
conviction of final doom had already begun to penetrate deeply
into his manhood.</p>
<p>He looked first up the avenue, then down, vacant of purpose,
seeing nothing in the moving pageant.&nbsp; Finally, as if
aroused by certain curious <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>glances that the less hurried
passers-by cast on him, he bestirred himself and moved on down
the avenue, his shoulders stooped, his legs trailing wearily.</p>
<p>Thus he proceeded for several blocks, never raising his head,
stopping mechanically at the street crossings, resuming his
discouraged pace as the crowd moved on.&nbsp; Once he plunged his
hand into his coat pocket, to assure himself of some possession,
and then withdrew it with a bitter smile for his unconscious
anxiety.</p>
<p>When in this vacant promenade he had reached the lower part of
the avenue, where the crowd was less dense, and less gay and rich
in appearance, he lifted his head and looked musingly into the
misty space before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he muttered, with tightening lips,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s only one more throw-down.&nbsp; I ought to be
used to &rsquo;em by now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, his face relapsed into its melancholy expression
as he turned into one of the side streets with the unconscious
precision of the animal following a beaten path to its hole.</p>
<p>He crossed several of the shabbier commercial avenues, which
were crowded with traffic and blocked by men and women returning
from the day&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; Compared with these tired
laborers, he seemed to have a large leisure&mdash;the freedom <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>of absolute
poverty.&nbsp; His thoughts had turned to supper.&nbsp; Should he
buy a roll and a piece of pie at the bakery on the next corner,
or&mdash;mad venture!&mdash;dissipate his last resources at the
saloon opposite, where the Italian wife of the Irish proprietor
offered appetizing nourishment for a quarter?</p>
<p>Meditating upon this important decision, the young man entered
his own block.&nbsp; At one end the elevated trains rattled; at
the other, heavy drays lumbered past in an unbroken file on their
way to the ferries; but between the two there was a strip of
quiet, where the dingy old houses were withdrawn from the street,
and in front of them a few dusty shrubs struggled for life in the
bare plots of earth.</p>
<p>In the middle of this block there was an unusually animated
scene.&nbsp; A group of children had huddled together about some
object of interest.&nbsp; A horse must have fallen on the
pavement, the young man thought dully, or there was a fight, or a
policeman had made a capture.</p>
<p>He hurried his lagging steps, moved by a boyish
curiosity.&nbsp; As he drew nearer, he perceived that the circle
was too small to contain a horse or a good scrap.&nbsp; The
center of interest must be some unfortunate human being.&nbsp; He
shouldered his way through the crowd.</p>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; he asked of a small
boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A drunk,&rdquo; was the laconic reply.</p>
<p>Looking over the heads of the boys, the young man could see
the figure of a stoutish, well-dressed man lying prone on the
pavement.&nbsp; His black coat was spattered with mud, his gray
hair rumpled.&nbsp; His eyes were closed, and through the open
lips his tongue protruded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, he&rsquo;s bad!&rdquo; the boy observed
knowingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just look at him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A convulsion shook the prostrate figure.&nbsp; The face began
to twitch, and one arm waved violently, beating the air.&nbsp;
One or two more mature passers-by who had been attracted by the
disturbance drew off, with the selfish city excuse that the
proper authorities would come in time and attend to the
nuisance.&nbsp; Not so the idle young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t drunk!&rdquo; he exclaimed, pushing his
way into the circle and stooping over the figure.&nbsp; He had
seen too many plain &ldquo;drunks&rdquo; in his newspaper days to
be deceived in the symptoms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he goes again!&rdquo; the boys shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has some sort of fit.&nbsp; Here, one of you give me
a hand, and we&rsquo;ll get him off the street!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys readily helped the young man to drag the prostrate
figure to the nearest steps, and one of them ran to the corner
after a policeman.&nbsp; <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>When the officer arrived, the young
man, who had steadied the stranger through another convulsion,
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to call an ambulance.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;d better carry him somewhere&mdash;can&rsquo;t let him
lie here in the street like a dog.&nbsp; We can take him to my
room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He motioned toward the next house, and with the
officer&rsquo;s assistance carried the sick man into the rear
room on the first floor, which he unlocked.&nbsp; Then the
policeman drove the curious boys out of the house and went off to
summon the ambulance.&nbsp; Left alone, the young man dipped a
towel in his water-pitcher, wet the sick man&rsquo;s brow, then
wiped his face and cleaned the foam and dirt from his beard and
lips.</p>
<p>The stranger, lying with half-closed eyes, looked to be rather
more than sixty years of age.&nbsp; Judging from the quality of
his clothes, and from his smooth hands, he was a well-to-do
business man.&nbsp; Presently his eyelids began to twitch, then
the whole face; the right leg shot out and beat the air; then the
right arm began to wave, and foam oozed from his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish they&rsquo;d hurry that ambulance!&rdquo; the
young man thought, as he wiped the sick man&rsquo;s face again
with the damp towel.&nbsp; &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t last long, at
this rate!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>This
convulsion gradually passed off as the others had, and the
stranger lay once more as if dead, his eyes almost wholly
closed.&nbsp; The young man went to the door and listened
nervously, then returned to the prostrate form, unbuttoned the
coat, and felt for the heart.&nbsp; Immediately the sick man
opened his eyes, and, looking directly into the eyes of the man
bending over him, tried to raise his hand, as if he would protect
himself from a blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; the young man said
reassuringly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was just feeling for your heart,
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sick man&rsquo;s lips twitched desperately; and finally,
in the faintest whisper, he managed to stammer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh-who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One Edgar Brainard,&rdquo; the young man replied
promptly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me unfasten this vest and make you
more comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-n-no!&rdquo; the sick man gasped suspiciously.</p>
<p>He managed to clutch Brainard&rsquo;s wrist with his wavering
right hand; his left lay quite powerless by his side.&nbsp; His
eyes closed again, but the lips moved silently, as if he were
trying to frame sounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going this time, sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man slipped his wrist from the feeble grasp,
inserted a pillow under the sick man&rsquo;s head, and sat back
to wait.</p>
<h3><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>II</h3>
<p>It was very still in that back room.&nbsp; No step sounded in
the hall, and the noise from the street came muffled.&nbsp; In
the stillness, the sick man&rsquo;s desperate efforts to breathe
filled the little room with painful sounds.&nbsp; Brainard felt
the stifling approach of death, and opened the window wide to get
what air would come in from the small court outside.</p>
<p>He studied the figure on the lounge more closely.&nbsp; The
thick, red under lip curled over the roots of the gray
beard.&nbsp; A short, thick nose gave the face a look of strong
will, even of obstinacy.&nbsp; There was a foreign expression to
the features that might indicate German descent.</p>
<p>On the third finger of his right hand, the sick man wore an
old, plain gold ring, which had sunk deep into the flesh.&nbsp;
From the inside pocket of his short coat bulged a thick wallet,
over which his right hand rested, as if to guard precious
possessions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thought I was going to rob him!&rdquo; Brainard
observed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Expect he&rsquo;s been up against it
already&mdash;and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>It was
quite dark.&nbsp; The young man lighted a gas-jet, then went
again to the door.&nbsp; As he stood there, listening, he felt
the old man&rsquo;s eyes on him, and turned to look at him.&nbsp;
The eyes, now wide open, held him, asking what the lips refused
to utter.</p>
<p>Brainard went back to his patient and leaned over to catch the
flutter from the moving lips.&nbsp; At last, as if with great
exertion, the murmur came:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh-wh-what are you go-going to do&mdash;to
do&mdash;with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of the faintness of the whisper, it was the voice of
one accustomed to being answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sent an officer for an ambulance,&rdquo;
Brainard replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;It ought to be here before now, I
should think.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll take you to some hospital and
fix you up,&rdquo; he added encouragingly.</p>
<p>The lips twitched into a semblance of a smile, then
mumbled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;not&mdash;th-this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter&mdash;accident?&rdquo; Brainard
asked.</p>
<p>The sick man did not attempt to reply, as if he considered the
question of trifling importance.&nbsp; Instead, his eyes studied
the young man&rsquo;s face intently.&nbsp; Evidently his brain
was clearing from the shock, whatever had caused it, and he was
revolving some purpose.&nbsp; Soon the lips began to <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>move once
more, and Brainard bent close to catch the faint sounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh-wh-what&rsquo;s your bus-bus-i-ness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve had lots of businesses,&rdquo; the young
man replied carelessly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Been on a newspaper, in the
ad business, real estate, and so on.&rdquo;&nbsp; He added after
a moment, with a little ironical laugh, &ldquo;Just now I&rsquo;m
in the literary business&mdash;a dramatist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sick man looked puzzled, and frowned, as if
disappointed.&nbsp; Perhaps his cloudy brain could not assort
this information with his purpose.&nbsp; Presently his brow
contracted, his face twitched violently, the right leg shot
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; the young man
exclaimed sympathetically.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish I knew what to do
for you.&nbsp; Where can that ambulance be?&rdquo;&nbsp; He laid
one hand on the sick man&rsquo;s hot brow, and held his arm with
the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;Easy now!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as the
right arm began whirling.&nbsp; &ldquo;There!&nbsp; Steady!&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s going off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of closing his eyes, as he had done after the previous
attacks, and relapsing into coma, the sick man made an immediate
effort to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Co-come here,&rdquo; he articulated faintly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Important, very important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He groped feebly for his inner pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want me to take out this bundle?&rdquo; <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Brainard
asked, laying his hand on the bulky wallet.</p>
<p>The man made an affirmative sign, and kept his eyes steadily
on Brainard while the latter gently extracted the pocketbook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you will do something for me?&rdquo; the
stranger said more distinctly than he had hitherto spoken, as if
urgency were clearing his mind.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can&mdash;you
can start to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not very busy,&rdquo; the young man said,
with a laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;I guess I could start for Hong-Kong on
a few minutes&rsquo; notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Hong-Kong,&rdquo; the old man labored forth
literally.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re honest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was said in a tone of self-conviction rather than of
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess so,&rdquo; the young man answered
lightly.&nbsp; &ldquo;At least, what&rsquo;s called
honest&mdash;never had a chance to steal anything worth
taking!&rdquo;&nbsp; He added more seriously, to quiet the sick
man, who seemed to be laboring under excitement, &ldquo;Tell me
what you want done, and I&rsquo;ll do my best to put it through
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sick man&rsquo;s eyes expressed relief, and then his brow
contracted, as if he were summoning all his powers in a final
effort to make a clogged brain do his urgent will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lis-lis-listen,&rdquo; he murmured.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No&mdash;no, <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>write&mdash;write it down,&rdquo; he went on, as
Brainard leaned forward.</p>
<p>Brainard looked about his bare room for paper, but in
vain.&nbsp; He felt in his pockets for a stray envelope, then
drew from his overcoat a roll of manuscript.&nbsp; He glanced at
it dubiously for a moment, then tore off the last sheet, which
had on one side a few lines of typewriting.&nbsp; With a gesture
of indifference, he turned to the sick man and prepared to take
his message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All ready,&rdquo; he remarked.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can take
it in shorthand, if you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sev-en, thir-ty-one, and four.&nbsp; Sev-en,
thir-tyone, and four.&nbsp; Sev-en, thir-ty-one, and four,&rdquo;
he repeated almost briskly.</p>
<p>Brainard looked at him inquiringly, and the stranger whispered
the explanation: &ldquo;Combi-na-tion pri-vate
safe&mdash;understand?&rdquo;&nbsp; Brainard nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Office&mdash;San Francisco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man whistled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good ways off!&nbsp; What do you want me
to do there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take <i>everything</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do with the stuff?&nbsp; Bring it here to
New York?&rdquo; the young man inquired, with growing
curiosity.</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>The
sick man&rsquo;s blue eyes stared at him steadily, with a look of
full intelligence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be dead then,&rdquo; he mumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope not!&rdquo; Brainard remarked.</p>
<p>But with unflinching eyes, the sick man continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have&mdash;pow-er&mdash;pow-er of
attorney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He brought the words out with difficulty, not wasting his
strength by discussing his chances of recovery.&nbsp; He was
evidently growing weaker, and Brainard had to bend close to his
lips in order to catch the faint whisper, &ldquo;Take it
down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with his face beginning to twitch, and the convulsive
tremors running over his body, the sick man summoned all his will
and managed to dictate a power of attorney in legal terms, as if
he were familiar with the formula.&nbsp; When he had finished,
his eyes closed, and his lips remained open.&nbsp; Brainard
dropped his paper and felt for the sick man&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp;
It was still beating faintly.</p>
<p>After a few moments, the eyes opened mistily, and again the
man made an effort to collect himself for another effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do with the stuff?&rdquo; Brainard
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ge-get it out of the country.&nbsp; Take it to&mdash;to
Ber-Ber-Ber&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>&ldquo;Bermuda?&rdquo; Brainard suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ber<i>lin</i>!&rdquo; the sick man corrected with a
frown.&nbsp; As if to impress his messenger with the seriousness
of his work, he added, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t get away,
they&rsquo;ll&mdash;kill you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Brainard exclaimed, impressed.</p>
<p>The blue eyes examined the young man steadily, as if they
would test his metal.&nbsp; Then, satisfied, the man
murmured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick&mdash;must&mdash;sign&mdash;quick!&nbsp;
Now!&rdquo; he concluded, as his face began to twitch.</p>
<p>Brainard handed him a pen, and held his right arm to steady
him while he scrawled his name&mdash;&ldquo;H.
Krutzmacht.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sick man traced the letters slowly,
patiently, persisting until he had dashed a heavy line across the
t&rsquo;s and another beneath the name; then he dropped the pen
and closed his eyes.</p>
<p>When another moment of control came to him, he whispered
uneasily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Witness?&nbsp; Must have witness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find some one&mdash;don&rsquo;t
worry,&rdquo; the young man replied lightly.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
ambulance man, when he comes, if he ever does come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard did not yet take very seriously the idea of starting
that night for San Francisco to rifle a safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mo-mo-money,&rdquo; the voice began, and the <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>eyes wandered
to the fat wallet which Brainard had deposited on the table.</p>
<p>Brainard lifted the wallet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plen-plen-plenty of mon-money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; the young man replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s enough cash for the journey in
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he laid the wallet down, there was the welcome sound of
feet in the passage outside, and with an exclamation of relief
the young man flung open the door.&nbsp; The ambulance surgeon
was there with an assistant and a stretcher.&nbsp; With a
muttered explanation for his delay, the doctor went at once to
the sick man and examined him, while Brainard told what he knew
of his strange guest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tries to talk all the time&mdash;must be something on
his mind!&rdquo; he said, as another convulsion seized the sick
man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Been doped, I should say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like brain trouble, sure,&rdquo; the ambulance
surgeon remarked, watching the stranger closely.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
can&rsquo;t last long that way.&nbsp; Well, we&rsquo;d better
hustle him to the hospital as soon as we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had the sick man on the stretcher before he had opened
his eyes from his last attack.&nbsp; As they lifted him, he
mumbled excitedly, and Brainard, listening close to his lips,
thought he understood what was troubling him.</p>
<p><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>&ldquo;He wants that paper witnessed,&rdquo; he
explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;I forgot&mdash;it&rsquo;s something he
dictated to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, hurry up about it,&rdquo; the surgeon replied
carelessly, willing to humor the sick man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard dipped his pen in the ink-bottle and handed it to the
surgeon, who lightly dashed down his signature at the bottom of
the sheet, without reading it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now are we ready?&rdquo; the doctor demanded
impatiently.</p>
<p>But the blue eyes arrested Brainard, and the young man,
stooping over the stretcher, caught a faint whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll g-g-go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gi-gi-give it all to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Krutzmacht struggled hard to pronounce a name, but he could
not utter the word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use!&rdquo; the doctor exclaimed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tell him to wait until he&rsquo;s better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Brainard, moved by the sick man&rsquo;s intense look of
mental distress, raised his hand to the doctor and
listened.&nbsp; At last the whispered syllable reached his
ear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;M-M-Mel&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you it&rsquo;s no use!&rdquo; the ambulance
doctor <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>repeated irritably.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll find out
at the hospital what he wants done.&nbsp; Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they bore the stretcher through the narrow door, the
agonized expression gave way, and the sick man articulated more
distinctly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mel-Melo&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Melo-melodrama!&rdquo; Brainard said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, my friend.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
worry&mdash;I&rsquo;ll fix it up for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With astonishing distinctness came back the one word:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Melody!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right&mdash;Melody!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sick man would have said more, but the ambulance men bore
him swiftly to the waiting vehicle and shoved him in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you come along?&rdquo; the doctor asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll look in some time to-morrow,
probably&mdash;St. Joseph&rsquo;s, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sick man&rsquo;s eyes still rested on Brainard, when the
latter poked his head into the dark ambulance.&nbsp; They seemed
to glow with a full intelligence, and also with a command, as if
they said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do just what I&rsquo;ve told you to do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knows what he wants, even if he can&rsquo;t say
it,&rdquo; Brainard muttered to himself as the ambulance moved
off.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor old boy!&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>III</h3>
<p>When Brainard opened the door of his room, he heard the rustle
of papers on the floor, blown about by the draft from the
window.&nbsp; He lighted his lamp and picked up the loose sheets,
which were the typewritten leaves of his last play&mdash;the one
that he had finally got back that very afternoon from a famous
actor-manager, without even the usual note of polite regret from
the secretary.&nbsp; The absence of that familiar note had
dejected him especially.</p>
<p>He shoved the rejected play into his table drawer
indifferently, thinking of the sick man&rsquo;s last urgent look,
and of the terrible effort he had made to articulate his final
words.&nbsp; What did he mean by &ldquo;Melody&rdquo;?&nbsp;
Perhaps the old fellow was really out of his head, and all the
rest about his valuable papers in some private safe at the other
end of the continent was mythical&mdash;the fancy of an unhinged
mind.</p>
<p>But the memory of the old man&rsquo;s face&mdash;of those keen
blue eyes&mdash;made Brainard reject such a commonplace solution
of the puzzle.&nbsp; The <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>sick man had been in this room with
him for a full half-hour, and the place still seemed filled with
his positive, commanding personality.</p>
<p>No!&nbsp; The man who signed &ldquo;H. Krutzmacht&rdquo; to
the sheet lying on the table before him was no vague
lunatic.&nbsp; Though he might be at the extremity of life,
almost unable to articulate, nevertheless his purpose was clear
to himself, and his will was as strong as ever.</p>
<p>Brainard was hungry.&nbsp; Snatching up his old cap, he went
out to the neighboring avenue, and, without hesitation, entered
the most expensive restaurant in sight&mdash;a resort he
frequented only on rare days of opulence.&nbsp; Instead of the
oyster-stew and doughnuts which had latterly been his luxurious
limit, he ordered a good dinner, as if he had earned it, and
devoured the food without the usual qualms of prudence.</p>
<p>His spirits had undergone a marvelous change from the timid,
fearful state in which he had been that afternoon.&nbsp; He
wondered at his own confidence.&nbsp; Complacently selecting a
good cigar at the cashier&rsquo;s desk, he strolled back to his
room, his body peacefully engaged in the unaccustomed task of
digesting a full meal.</p>
<p>When he entered his dreary little room, his eye fell upon the
wallet, which lay under the table where he had dropped it.&nbsp;
What was he going to <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>do with that&mdash;with this whole
Krutzmacht business?&nbsp; Why, simply nothing at all.&nbsp; In
the morning, he would go around to St. Joseph&rsquo;s and see how
the sick man was.&nbsp; If Krutzmacht recovered, there was
nothing to do but to return his pocketbook.&nbsp; But if he got
worse, or was dead already?&nbsp; Well, Brainard could turn the
wallet over to the hospital people or the coroner, and that would
end the affair for him.</p>
<p>With this prudent resolution he took his play from the drawer,
and looked it over.&nbsp; His interest in the thing had quite
gone, and the sting of its rejection no longer smarted.&nbsp;
Very likely it was as bad as the managers to whom he had
submitted it seemed to think.&nbsp; He tied the manuscript
together with a piece of twine, and shoved it back into the
drawer.</p>
<p>One sheet&mdash;that last one on which he had taken down
Krutzmacht&rsquo;s dictation&mdash;was missing from this
roll.&nbsp; That sheet contained his final curtain.&nbsp; He
looked at the lines, and smiled as he read.&nbsp; The Lady Violet
was parting from her lover, with the following dialogue:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Violet</span>.&mdash;Oh,
Alexander!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alexander</span>.&mdash;Violet!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Violet</span>.&mdash;What will you do,
dearest?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alexander</span>.&mdash;I go on my great
adventure!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Violet</span>.&mdash;Your great
adventure?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alexander</span>.&mdash;Life!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>He
turned the sheet over.&nbsp; On the other side were the few
shorthand notes he had hastily jotted down&mdash;the figures of
the safe combination and the power of attorney with its legal
phrases, the latter written out again below in long hand.&nbsp;
At the bottom of the sheet, just beneath Alexander&rsquo;s heroic
announcement to Violet, were the three signatures.&nbsp; The old
man&rsquo;s blunt name dominated the others&mdash;a firm, black
scrawl with a couple of vicious dashes.</p>
<p>The powerful will of the sick man, working in what might be
the agony of death, spoke in that signature.&nbsp; Brainard felt
that there was something mysterious in it.&nbsp; The name spoke
to him as the eyes had spoken to him, personally.&nbsp;
Criminal?&nbsp; Possibly.&nbsp; Dramatic?&nbsp; Oh, surely!&nbsp;
He felt instinctively that there was more drama on this side of
the sheet than on the other.</p>
<p>He folded the paper carefully and put it in his inner
pocket.&nbsp; It would be an interesting souvenir.</p>
<p>As the young man sat and smoked in his little room, the
comfort of his abundant meal penetrating his person, he felt more
and more the drama of actual life touching him, calling to him to
take a hand in it.&nbsp; He reached unconsciously for the fat
wallet, and opened it.&nbsp; There were some legal
papers&mdash;contracts and leases and agreements, at which
Brainard merely glanced.</p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>He felt
into the inner recesses of the old-fashioned wallet, and from one
pocket extracted a thick sheaf of bank-notes.&nbsp; They were in
large denominations&mdash;hundreds, fifties, and twenties.&nbsp;
Brainard smoothed out the bills on his knee and carefully counted
them; in all there was rather more than four thousand
dollars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old boy traveled with quite a wad!&rdquo; he
muttered, fingering the crisp bills.</p>
<p>The touch of the money gave a curious electric thrill to his
thoughts.&nbsp; Here was an evidence of reality that made the old
man&rsquo;s mumbled words and intense effort assume a reasonable
shape.&nbsp; When Krutzmacht let Brainard take possession of this
wallet, he knew what it contained.&nbsp; He trusted to a stranger
in his desperate need.</p>
<p>Still feeling around in the folds of the wallet, Brainard
extracted a railroad-ticket of voluminous length for San
Francisco.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was on his way to the train!&rdquo; Brainard
exclaimed, and added unconsciously, &ldquo;when they got him and
did him up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Already his busy mind had accepted the hypothesis of enemies
and foul play rather than that of disease.</p>
<p>With the railroad-ticket and the money in his hand, he stood
staring before him, still debating the matter.&nbsp; Something
seemed to rise within <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>him, some determination&mdash;a
spirit of daring which he had not felt for years.</p>
<p>Mechanically he put the papers and bank-notes back into the
wallet, and shoved it into his pocket.&nbsp; Then he looked at
his watch.&nbsp; It was nearly ten o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; If he was
to leave to-night, as the old man had ordered, there was no more
time to lose.</p>
<p>Without further hesitation, he threw a few articles into an
old bag and started for the ferry.&nbsp; On the way he stopped to
telephone the hospital.&nbsp; After a delay which made him
impatient, he learned that the sick man was resting
quietly&mdash;&ldquo;still unconscious,&rdquo; the nurse
said.&nbsp; So he had not spoken again.</p>
<p>When Brainard reached the station in Jersey City, having a few
moments to spare, he wrote a brief note to the hospital
authorities, saying that he was leaving the city on business, and
would call on his return in a week or ten days.&nbsp; He inclosed
several bank-notes, requesting that the sick man should have
every comfort.&nbsp; Having dropped his letter into the box he
stepped into the Chicago sleeper.&nbsp; The exhilarating beat of
his heart told him that he had done well.</p>
<p>The disdainful look that the porter had given him when he took
charge of his shabby bag, as well as the curious glances of his
fellow passengers, the next morning, made Brainard conscious of
his <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>eccentric appearance.&nbsp; But all that he could do,
for the present, to improve his neglected person, was to have
himself shaved and his hair cut.&nbsp; He was obliged to keep his
rain-coat on, although the car was hot, in order to cover up a
large hole in his trousers&mdash;the only pair he possessed.</p>
<p>He resolved to employ the few hours in Chicago, between
trains, in making himself as decent as possible.&nbsp; Meanwhile
he ate three good meals and furtively watched his more prosperous
fellow travelers.</p>
<h3><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>IV</h3>
<p>It was a very different person, in appearance, who seated
himself on the observation platform of the Overland Limited that
evening.&nbsp; Only the round steel spectacles were left as a
memento of Brainard&rsquo;s former condition.&nbsp; He had had no
scruples in helping himself freely from the store of bills in the
wallet.&nbsp; What lay before him to do for the sick man would
probably be difficult, in any event, and it would be foolish to
handicap himself by presenting a suspicious appearance at
Krutzmacht&rsquo;s office.&nbsp; He would play his part properly
dressed.</p>
<p>So, when he glanced into the little mirror beside his berth,
he smiled in satisfaction at the clean-shaven, neatly dressed,
alert young man who looked back at him.&nbsp; With his ragged
habiliments he seemed also to have discarded that settled look of
failure, and not a few of his years.&nbsp; Without unduly
flattering himself, he felt that he might easily be taken for one
of the energetic young brokers or lawyers whom he observed on the
train.</p>
<p>Removing his new hat, and stretching his well-shod feet on the
cushioned seat opposite, he took <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>up the evening newspapers and glanced
through them for some telegraphic item about the fate of his
mysterious employer.&nbsp; If Krutzmacht were a well-known
figure, as he supposed likely, reporters must doubtless have
discovered him before this and proclaimed his predicament to the
world.&nbsp; But Brainard could find no reference to any such
person in the newspapers, and with a sigh of relief he let them
slip from his lap.</p>
<p>His task would be easier, if it could be accomplished while
the sick man lay undiscovered in the hospital.&nbsp; If he should
already be dead, when he arrived, there would be an end to
Brainard&rsquo;s job altogether; and that would have been a keen
disappointment to the young man.</p>
<p>His job?&nbsp; A hundred times his mind reverted to this
perplexing consideration&mdash;what, exactly, was he to do when
he had reached the end of his long journey?</p>
<p>First, he would find where Krutzmacht&rsquo;s offices were,
and then?&nbsp; He had been told to make off with whatever he
might find in the private safe.&nbsp; For this purpose he had
provided himself, in Chicago, with a bulky leather valise, in
which his discarded raiment was now reposing.&nbsp; It all
sounded like an expedition in high piracy, but he quieted any
scruples with the resolve that he would make off merely to New
York, if Krutzmacht still lived, <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>instead of Berlin, and remain there
to await further developments.</p>
<p>So, as the Overland Limited rushed across the prairie states,
Brainard took counsel with himself, mentally sketching out his
every move from the moment when he should step from the
train.&nbsp; The readiness with which his mind reached out to
this new situation surprised himself; he was already becoming in
some way a new person.</p>
<p>The journey itself was a revelation to him and an
education.&nbsp; With his Broadway prejudice that the United
States stopped somewhere just above the Bronx and behind the
Jersey hills, he was astonished to find so much habitable country
beyond these horizons and so many people in it who did not seem
to depend upon New York City for their livelihood or
happiness.&nbsp; At first he was so much preoccupied with his
errand and himself in his surprising new r&ocirc;le that he paid
little attention to the scenes spread before his eyes.&nbsp;
Chicago impressed him only as a dirtier and more provincial New
York.&nbsp; But the next morning when he awoke at Omaha he began
to realize that America was more than a strip of land along the
Atlantic seaboard, and by the time the train had left Ogden his
respect for his fatherland had immensely increased.</p>
<p>He noticed also that the character of the people <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>on the train
was gradually changing.&nbsp; Large, rough-looking men, with
tanned faces not too carefully shaved, and sometimes with a queer
assortment of jewelry and patent leather shoes took the places of
the pallid, smooth shaven business men that had been his
companions from Jersey City to Chicago.&nbsp; There were also a
number of women traveling alone, large, competent, and not
overrefined.&nbsp; Brainard, whose ideas of Americans other than
the types to be seen on the streets of New York had been drawn
from the travestied figures of the stage,&mdash;the miner and the
cowboy with flapping sombrero and chaps,&mdash;watched these new
specimens of his fellow countrymen with keen interest.&nbsp; In
spite of their rather uncouth speech and their familiarity with
the negro porters, they were attractive.&nbsp; They had a
vigorous air about them, indicating that they came from a big
country, with big ways of doing things in it, and a broad outlook
over wide horizons.&nbsp; The would-be dramatist began to
perceive that the world was not peopled wholly by the types that
the American stage had made familiar to him.</p>
<p>A little way beyond Ogden the train rolled out into the bright
blue inland sea of the Great Salt Lake and trundled on for mile
after mile in the midst of the water on a narrow strip of rocky
roadbed.&nbsp; Brainard had read in the newspapers <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>of this
famous &ldquo;Lucin cut-off&rdquo; where in an effort to save a
detour of a few miles around the shore of the lake millions of
tons of &ldquo;fill&rdquo; had been dumped into an apparently
bottomless hole.&nbsp; The pluck and the energy of that road
builder who had conceived this work and kept at it month after
month, dumping trainloads of rock into a great lake had not
specially thrilled him when he read of it.&nbsp; But now the
imagination and the courage of the little man who did this sort
of thing thrilled him.&nbsp; Harriman, the bold doer of this and
greater things, was of course a popular Wall Street hero to the
New Yorker,&mdash;one of those legendary creatures who were
supposed to have their seat of power in the lofty cliffs of that
narrow Via Dolorosa and somehow like the alchemists of old
conjure great fortunes out of air, with the aid of the
&ldquo;tape.&rdquo;&nbsp; That was the way in which this young
man had always thought of Harriman,&mdash;&ldquo;the wizard of
railroad finance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But now as he glided smoothly over the solid roadbed that ran
straight westward into the remote distance with the salt waves
almost lapping the tracks and leaving a white crust from their
spume, with lofty mountains looming to south and to
north,&mdash;as he stood on the rear platform of the heavy steel
train observing this marvelous panorama,&mdash;a totally new
conception of the renowned <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>financier came to him.&nbsp; This was
not done by watching the tape!&nbsp; It demanded will and force
and imagination and faith&mdash;spiritual qualities in a
man&mdash;to do this.&nbsp; The young traveler mentally did
homage to the character that had created the wonderful highway
over which for a day and a half he had been comfortably borne in
luxurious ease.</p>
<p>As he watched the blue mountains about Ogden fade into the
haze, it seemed that New York, his life there, and all his
conventional conceptions of the little world in which he had
vainly struggled for existence also receded and grew smaller,
less real.&nbsp; The train in its westward flight was bearing him
forward into a new world, within as well as without!&nbsp; As the
track began to wind up again to higher levels before taking its
next great leap over the Sierras, Brainard went forward to the
smoking room, his usual post of observation, where he sat through
long, meditative hours, listening to the talk about him and
gazing at the fleeting landscape.&nbsp; Whatever else it might
mean,&mdash;this jaunt across the continent on a stranger&rsquo;s
errand,&mdash;it was bringing him a rich cargo of new ideas.</p>
<p>Of all his fellow travelers the man who happened to occupy the
drawing-room in the car where Brainard had his section aroused
his <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>curiosity especially.&nbsp; He was one of those
well-dressed, alert young business men who had made Brainard
conscious of his shabby and inappropriate appearance when he
first started on his journey.&nbsp; The door of his room had been
closed all the way to Chicago, and Brainard had seen nothing of
the man.&nbsp; But since the train left Omaha the door to the
drawing-room had been open, and from his section Brainard
observed its occupant diligently reading a book.&nbsp; What
aroused his attention and interested him in the stranger more
than his pleasant appearance of frank good humor had been the
sort of book he had chosen for this long journey.&nbsp; It was
bound like a &ldquo;best seller&rdquo; in a gaudy red cloth, and
a picture of a starry-eyed maiden with floating hair adorned the
cover.&nbsp; But it was labeled in unmistakable black letters
<i>Paradise Lost</i>.&nbsp; Brainard, who had made a painful and
superficial acquaintance in his youth with this poetic
masterpiece, decided that the smartly dressed young American
could not be devoting the journey to Milton&rsquo;s epic.&nbsp;
It must be that some writer of best sellers had cribbed the great
poet&rsquo;s title and fitted it to a less strenuous tale of love
and starry-eyed maidens.&nbsp; This theory, however, broke down
before the fact that from time to time the young man consulted a
small black book that was indubitably a <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>dictionary,
and Brainard taking advantage of a moment when the traveler had
left his room assured himself that the book was really a copy of
Milton&rsquo;s poem set within profane modern covers.&nbsp; Just
why this young man should spend his hours on the train reading
the puritan epic of heaven and hell puzzled Brainard and whetted
his curiosity to know what sort of man the stranger was.</p>
<p>Earlier this morning as the train was climbing down from the
Rockies into Utah, an opportunity had come to speak to his fellow
traveler.&nbsp; The train had pulled up somewhere before a
desolate station whose architect had tried to make a Queen Anne
cottage that looked singularly out of place in the bare, wild
landscape.&nbsp; While the engine took its long drink, the
passengers stretched their legs and enjoyed the crisp mountain
air.&nbsp; The stranger came to the vestibule, yawned, and read
the name of the station:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Palisade, is it? . . .&nbsp; The last time I was over
this way it looked more lively than this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was happening?&rdquo; Brainard inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a bunch of miners somewheres in Utah making
trouble, on a strike.&nbsp; The company had brought in a couple
of carloads of greasers, and the miners were down here shooting
up the party.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>He got
down to the ground, yawned again, and opened a gold cigarette
case which he offered to Brainard,&mdash;&ldquo;Have
one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard took one of the monogrammed cigarettes, and they
sauntered together in the sunlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; his new acquaintance continued,
&ldquo;they sure did have a lively time.&nbsp; The greasers were
over there on the siding in their cars, and they just let go at
&rsquo;em with their guns.&nbsp; Now and then they&rsquo;d hit
the station, for fun, you know.&nbsp; I guess maybe you can see
the holes yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man pointed up at some scars among the shingles and
a broken window in the upper story.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sure enough they
left their marks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did they do to &rsquo;em?&rdquo; Brainard asked
na&iuml;vely, as they returned to the car when the conductor
droned &ldquo;all aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; the stranger asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waved a hand at the desolate stretch of sage brush backed
by grim mountains and laughed.&nbsp; As the train moved off, he
added, &ldquo;Lord, I don&rsquo;t know!&nbsp; They were still
popping when my train pulled out.&nbsp; There weren&rsquo;t many
greasers fit to work in the mines.&nbsp; What was left after the
reception must have walked home&mdash;a long ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard was somewhat impressed with the <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>possibilities
of a country that could offer such a scrap, <i>en passant</i>, so
to speak.&nbsp; The stranger invited him into his room and gave
him another cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From New York?&rdquo; he inquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not a
bad sort of place,&rdquo; he observed tolerantly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ever been on the Coast?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve something to
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is San Francisco since the earthquake?&rdquo;
Brainard inquired, thinking to come cautiously and guardedly to
the topic of Krutzmacht.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all there and more than ever,&rdquo; the
stranger cheerily responded.&nbsp; &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t find
any large cracks,&rdquo; he jested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer that you all went straight back to the
same ground and built over again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&nbsp; It was home, wasn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; Folks
always have a feeling for the place they&rsquo;ve lived in, even
if it has disadvantages.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s only human!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard reflected that this was a sentimental point of view
he should hardly have expected from the practical sort of man
opposite him.&nbsp; In the course of their conversation Brainard
inquired about the graft prosecution then in full swing, which
had attracted the notice even of eastern papers on account of the
highly melodramatic flavor that a picturesque prosecuting
attorney had given to the proceedings.&nbsp; The man from San
Francisco readily gave his point of view, which <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>was
unfavorable to the virtuous citizens engaged in the task of civic
purification.&nbsp; When Brainard asked about the celebrated
prosecuting attorney, the stranger looked at him for the first
time suspiciously, and said coldly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as that gentleman has just been parading up and
down the state saying he was going to put me in state prison for
the better part of my remaining years, I can&rsquo;t say I have a
high opinion of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; Brainard emitted feebly.&nbsp; The
stranger was more mysterious than ever.&nbsp; He did not seem in
the least like a candidate for state prison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; the young man continued cheerfully,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m loose now on about seventy-five thousand dollars
of bonds.&nbsp; Time was up in fact day before yesterday, and
I&rsquo;ve been wondering some what they are going to do to my
bondsmen.&nbsp; Well, we&rsquo;ll find out at Ogden when we get
the coast papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when they reached Ogden Brainard ventured to inquire,
seeing his new acquaintance deep in the folds of a San Francisco
newspaper,&mdash;&ldquo;Well, what did they do to those
bondsmen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing yet, so far as I can see.&nbsp; Oh, hell,
it&rsquo;s all bluff anyway!&rdquo; and he dropped his newspaper
out of the open window. . . .</p>
<p><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>A man
of such cheerful and frank presence, who read <i>Paradise
Lost</i> (with the aid of a dictionary) and traveled to New York
on seventy-five thousand dollars of bail bonds was a curiosity to
Brainard.&nbsp; He very much wished to ask him a few impertinent
questions in order to satisfy his curiosity, but could not summon
sufficient courage, though he felt sure that the agreeable
stranger would cheerfully enlighten him.</p>
<h3><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>V</h3>
<p>As Brainard entered the smoking compartment of the &ldquo;club
car,&rdquo; he observed that his interesting fellow traveler was
in close conversation with a new arrival, who had taken the
section opposite Brainard at Ogden.&nbsp; He had already noted
this grizzled, thickset person, about sixty years old, who wore a
black frock coat, had a large seal ring and a massive Masonic
charm.&nbsp; When the newcomer opened his grip to extract a black
skull cap, he had seen that the remaining contents of the bag
were a mass of papers, a few bits of loose rock, and a bottle of
whisky.&nbsp; Whatever toilet articles the traveler carried were
carefully concealed.</p>
<p>Already the oldish, grizzled traveler with the skull cap was
at home, the center of a little group of men at one of the card
tables,&mdash;a bottle of beer in front of him, a cigar tilted at
an angle between his teeth.&nbsp; He was conversing with that
perfect naturalness and freedom that Brainard had observed was
the custom in this large country, even among complete
strangers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;I came back from
<a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>Alaska in
1907 broke,&mdash;that is, what you might call broke,&mdash;a
couple of thousand dollars all I had in the world.&nbsp; I said
to my wife, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m done with mines!&nbsp; For
good.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve spent the better part of thirty years
chasing gold, and there may be money to be got out of the ground,
but it ain&rsquo;t for me.&rsquo;&nbsp; And would you believe
it?&nbsp; The next morning I was starting for Union!&nbsp; Met a
man I knew at the hotel in Seattle and he showed me some samples
of the ore they were taking out there.&nbsp; And I started.&nbsp;
The old woman too.&nbsp; Been there ever since!&rdquo;&nbsp; He
paused as if to let the others say &ldquo;Kismet!&rdquo; and
repeated,&mdash;&ldquo;Been there ever since, working the next
claim.&nbsp; My wife died six months ago, and I got lonely and
thought I&rsquo;d come out and see what had happened to Frisco
since the quake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From this point the talk drifted on erratically as the train
rushed towards the Sierras.&nbsp; The agreeable young man who
read <i>Paradise Lost</i> and was under bonds to justice seemed
to have an extensive acquaintance in common with the grizzled
miner.&nbsp; They discussed some Scotchman who had been mining
but now owned an oil well in the &ldquo;Midway field&rdquo; that
was reputed to be bringing in five thousand dollars a day.&nbsp;
Another of their friends&mdash;an Englishman&mdash;had a silver
&ldquo;proposition&rdquo; in Mexico.&nbsp; There was also Jimmie
<a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>Birt who
owned a string of horses and had sunk a fortune in a mine in
British Columbia, but Jimmie, it seemed, was making good in
Oregon timber land.&nbsp; So it went with one adventurer after
another, roaming this side of the continent, now penniless,
to-morrow with millions, restlessly darting from subarctic Alaska
to subtropical Mexico along the coast or the mountain spine of
the continent.&nbsp; They sought gold and silver and copper, oil
and wood and cattle, water-power, wheat, and wine,&mdash;it made
little odds what.&nbsp; Everything was a &ldquo;big
proposition&rdquo; in which to make or lose.&nbsp; Brainard drank
in the varied biography of this company of adventurers, his brain
fired with the excitements of their risks.&nbsp; Krutzmacht, it
seemed to him, must have been such a one as these.&nbsp; He was
on the point of asking the old miner, who was the principal
talker, if he had ever heard of Krutzmacht, when his ears caught
the words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see by to-day&rsquo;s San Francisco paper that a
receivership has been asked for the Shasta companies.&nbsp; That
means they&rsquo;ve got Krutzmacht, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect so&mdash;he&rsquo;s been on the edge some time
from what I hear,&rdquo; the younger man replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they got him. . . .&nbsp; I thought Herb would make
good&mdash;he was a nervy Dutchman, if there <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>ever was
one!&nbsp; But he couldn&rsquo;t go up against that
crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he began building his road through the mountains
to the Bay, the S. P. crowd went for him and shut off his
credit.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got to get permission to do some
things in California.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m told he&rsquo;d built up a big
property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right&mdash;if he&rsquo;d been able to
hold on, there would have been millions, what with the power
company, the timber, the railroad, and the land.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s why the S. P. people wanted it!&nbsp; They waited,
and when the panic came on, they began squeezing him.&nbsp; I saw
him in New York a few days ago.&nbsp; I suppose he was trying to
get money from some of those big Jew bankers where he&rsquo;d got
it before.&nbsp; But it isn&rsquo;t the right time to pass the
hat in Wall Street just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The talk ran on desultorily about &ldquo;the S. P.
crowd,&rdquo; who it seemed were the financial dictators of the
Pacific Coast and &ldquo;the nerve of the Dutchman who went up
against that bunch.&rdquo;&nbsp; Brainard listened closely to
every word, but refrained from asking questions for fear of
betraying an undue interest in Krutzmacht.&nbsp; As far as he
could make out, with his inexperience in business affairs,
Krutzmacht&rsquo;s companies were valuable and solvent, but he
himself was embarrassed, as many men of large enterprises were at
this time, and his <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>enemies had taken this opportune moment to get
possession of his properties, using for that purpose the courts
of which they seemed to have control as they had of the
legislature and the governor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame,&rdquo; the younger stranger
remarked frankly; &ldquo;I expect they&rsquo;ll put him through
the mill and take every dollar he owns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll eat the hide off him all
right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; the miner sighed in
conclusion.&nbsp; &ldquo;So Herb&rsquo;s lost out!&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s a nervy one, though, obstinate as a mule.&nbsp;
Wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if he crawled through somehow.&nbsp; I
remember him years ago when he had a mine down in Arizona, a big
low-grade copper proposition.&nbsp; That was in nineteen four,
no,&mdash;three.&nbsp; It was another of those big schemes, too
big for any one man,&mdash;a railroad and a smelter besides the
mine.&nbsp; He claimed there was a fortune in it&mdash;and I
guess it was so&mdash;only he was forced to shut down, and the
next I heard of him he was out here on the Coast in this Shasta
proposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that was all they had to say about Krutzmacht.</p>
<h3><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>VI</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know who that man is?&rdquo; Brainard asked the
old miner as the gentleman under bonds to return to California
strolled out of the smoking room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s Eddie Hollinger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is Mr. Hollinger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, young feller, don&rsquo;t you ever read the papers
where you live?&nbsp; Why, he&rsquo;s the boss of the prize ring
business here on the Coast,&mdash;the &lsquo;fight trust,&rsquo;
as they call it.&nbsp; Made lots of money.&nbsp; Mighty fine
feller Ed is, too.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s having his troubles these
days the same as the rest of us.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re trying him
for bribery, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After he had delivered himself of an impassioned defense of
the &ldquo;business men who were being hounded by a lot of
hypocrites,&rdquo; Brainard led him back to Krutzmacht, or as the
miner preferred to call him, &ldquo;that nervy
Dutchman.&rdquo;&nbsp; But beyond elaborating the story of his
own personal encounter with the German a number of years before
somewhere in Arizona, the miner could add little to what had
already been told.&nbsp; The German was a daring and adventurous
man, <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>who
had been &ldquo;known on the Coast&rdquo; for thirty years or
more,&mdash;always involved in some large financial venture in
which he had been backed by capital from his native land.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s up and down with all of us,&rdquo; he
sighed in conclusion and drifted on to tell his own story.&nbsp;
He talked with the volubility and hopefulness of youth.&nbsp;
When he said that he hadn&rsquo;t seen a white man in six months
except the dozen &ldquo;dagoes&rdquo; working his claim, his
volubility seemed to Brainard excusable.&nbsp; It was less easy
to explain his hopeful mood, for it appeared that he had knocked
about the mountain states for the better part of a lifetime with
scarcely more to show for his efforts than what was contained in
his lean bag.&nbsp; But the roll of blue prints of his claim,
with the little bag of specimen ore, was in his eyes a sure
guarantee of fortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d oughter see my mine,&mdash;the Rosy Lee I
call it because that was my wife&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a
winner sure!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m expecting they&rsquo;ll break into
the vein every blast.&nbsp; May get a wire in Frisco that
they&rsquo;re in, and then you bet I&rsquo;ll go whooping back to
pick up the dollars!&nbsp; The Union, next door to me, so to
speak, got some ore that ran forty thousand to the
ton&mdash;they&rsquo;ve taken out four millions
already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rambled on about &ldquo;shoots,&rdquo;
&ldquo;winzes,&rdquo; <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>&ldquo;stopes,&rdquo;
&ldquo;faults,&rdquo; and geological formation until he had
thoroughly fired the young man&rsquo;s imagination with the
fascinating lure of the search for &ldquo;metal.&rdquo;&nbsp;
They examined the specimens in the old miner&rsquo;s bag and
talked far into the night while the train panted up the steep
grades and the moonlight lay white on the snowdrifts of the
mountains outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back with me, young feller,&rdquo; the miner said
in his simple, expansive manner, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll show you
some life you&rsquo;ve never seen! . . .&nbsp; It&rsquo;s kind of
lonesome up there now the old woman&rsquo;s gone. . . .&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll make money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to,&rdquo; Brainard responded
warmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing better!&nbsp; Perhaps I will some
day, but I can&rsquo;t this trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come soon,&rdquo; the old fellow urged, &ldquo;or
you&rsquo;ll find me at the Waldorf in your own town.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Brainard lay awake in his berth long afterwards, listening to
the laboring locomotives as they pulled the heavy train over the
mountains, rushed through the snowsheds, and emerged occasionally
to give glimpses of steep, snowy hillsides.&nbsp; The rarefied
air of the lofty altitude had set his pulses humming.&nbsp; So
much it seemed had happened to him already since he stepped
aboard the train in Jersey City that he could hardly <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>realize
himself.&nbsp; The &ldquo;boss of the fight trust&rdquo; and the
cheerful miner who had &ldquo;lost the old woman six months
back&rdquo; and still had faith after a lifetime of
disappointments that he would dig a fortune from that &ldquo;hole
up in them hills,&rdquo; were real experiences to the young
man.&nbsp; The simple, natural, human quality of these strangers
appealed to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;It must be the west,&rdquo; he
generalized easily.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose Krutzmacht is the same
sort,&mdash;large-hearted, simple, a good gambler.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But the man who had signed his name between convulsions,&mdash;H.
<span class="smcap">Krutzmacht</span>,&mdash;didn&rsquo;t seem to
fit the same genial frame.&nbsp; He was of sterner stuff.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Anyway he&rsquo;s given me one fine time and I&rsquo;ll do
what I can for him out there!&rdquo;&nbsp; It was useless to
speculate further as to what awaited him in San Francisco.&nbsp;
It might be that court proceedings having already begun, the
affair would be taken out of his hands completely.&nbsp; He might
find a telegram from Krutzmacht countermanding his orders.</p>
<p>At last he dropped to sleep, buoyant and eager for that
unknown future that lay before him, while the train having
surmounted the last mountain barrier wound slowly down into the
green, fruit-covered valleys of California.</p>
<h3><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>VII</h3>
<p>The Overland was several hours late; it was nearly four
o&rsquo;clock of a foggy April afternoon before Brainard emerged
from the ferry station with his big valise in his hand.&nbsp; His
first intention had been to go to a hotel and there deposit his
bag and make inquiries.&nbsp; The miner had urged him to
accompany him to the old &ldquo;Palace.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They
say it&rsquo;s finer than ever since the quake.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
Brainard, reflecting that it was Saturday afternoon and
considering that a few hours&rsquo; delay might mean the loss of
two days, shook hands with his fellow travelers and turned to the
telephone booths to discover Krutzmacht&rsquo;s city
address.&nbsp; When he had memorized the street and number he
started up Market Street, still carrying his bag.&nbsp; He was
astonished to see how thoroughly the city had recovered from its
disaster in little more than a year.&nbsp; There were large gaps
in the business blocks, to be sure, but it was a lively,
substantial city with a great deal of building going forward,
especially in the noisy erection of tall steel buildings.&nbsp;
The very sight of these ambitious structures inspired
courage!</p>
<p><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>After a
short walk Brainard found himself at the entrance of a large, new
building on Sutter Street that corresponded with the number he
had memorized.&nbsp; He stood on the curb for a few moments
staring up at the windows.&nbsp; Now that he had reached his
goal, a trace of his former habit of despondency came over him,
making him hesitate before the final effort, but shaking himself
free from the old morbidness he walked briskly into the
building.&nbsp; When he emerged from the elevator on the top
floor, the boy pointed down the corridor.&nbsp; &ldquo;The last
one on the right,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Brainard passed a number of offices whose doors bore in small
black letters the names of different
companies,&mdash;&ldquo;Pacific Northern Railroad,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Great Western Land and Improvement Company,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Shasta Corporation.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the extreme end of
the corridor was a door with the simple lettering, &ldquo;Herbert
Krutzmacht.&rdquo;&nbsp; The plain black letters of the name had
something of the same potency that the signature at the bottom of
the power of attorney had.&nbsp; Like that, like the sick man
himself who had painfully gasped out his last orders, they were a
part of the substantial realm of fact.&nbsp; So far, at least,
the dream held!&nbsp; There was a real man named Krutzmacht,
engaged in important business enterprises, and <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>from what
Brainard had learned on the train he knew that there was a crisis
in his affairs.</p>
<p>With his hand on the door-handle he paused.&nbsp; His heart
beat fast, and he looked around him nervously as if expecting to
see an officer of the court lurking somewhere in the
corridor.&nbsp; There was no one on this floor, however.&nbsp;
The quiet of a late Saturday afternoon had settled down on the
busy building, but within the private office Brainard could hear
the slow click of a typewriter.&nbsp; He pushed open the door and
entered.</p>
<p>It was a large, rather barely furnished room, evidently used
as an ante-room to other offices.&nbsp; Near the window a young
woman was seated at a desk, lazily examining a mass of papers and
occasionally tapping the keys of a machine, with the desultory
air of an employee killing time at the end of the day.&nbsp; She
was a distinctly good looking woman, Brainard observed, although
no longer young, with abundant coarse black hair, fresh
complexion, and decidedly plump.</p>
<p>The stenographer looked up from her work at Brainard with a
start as if she had been expecting some one, but quickly composed
herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; she asked with a peculiar
intonation that indicated hostility.</p>
<p>Brainard was at a loss for a reply and stood gaping at the
stenographer foolishly.&nbsp; He had <a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>not thought of meeting a woman.&nbsp;
He had known few women, and he lacked confidence in dealing with
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is&mdash;is Mr. Krutzmacht in?&rdquo; he stammered
awkwardly, and cursed himself for the silly question.</p>
<p>The woman gave him a suspicious look and answered shortly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; the young man remarked, looking about the
office.&nbsp; Near the stenographer&rsquo;s desk was a door
partly open, which led into an inner room.&nbsp; In the farther
corner of this room could be seen the projecting corner of a
steel safe.&nbsp; This Brainard felt must be his goal, and he
unconsciously stepped toward the door of the inner office.&nbsp;
The woman rose as if to bar his further progress and snapped
irritably:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I just want to talk to you,&rdquo; he replied as
amiably as he could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut it short then, young man.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t any
time to waste in conversazione.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem very busy!&rdquo; Brainard
observed smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always busy to strangers, little one&mdash;I
do my day-dreaming outside of office hours.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
thrust the metal cover on her machine with a clatter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;See?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I see,&rdquo; Brainard replied and again
tried to approach the inner office.&nbsp; The stenographer
confronted him alertly and folding her arms demanded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your game, anyway, young man?&nbsp; If
you&rsquo;re one of those lawyers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m no lawyer,&rdquo; Brainard said
laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Guess again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t the time.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s Saturday
afternoon, and this office is supposed to be closed at one
o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is Saturday&mdash;I&rsquo;d almost forgotten the
fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stenographer eyed him very sourly and observed coldly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you keep yourself that you don&rsquo;t know
the day of the week?&nbsp; Go home, young man, and think it
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard saw that in this national game of &ldquo;josh&rdquo;
he could make no progress against such an adept and came bluntly
to the point:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you in charge of Mr. Krutzmacht&rsquo;s
office?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve been sent here by Mr. Krutzmacht
to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sent here by Mr. Krutzmacht&mdash;the one you were
asking for just now? . . .&nbsp; Try something else,
sonny.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>Brainard felt foolish and completely baffled.&nbsp; He
wanted to strangle the woman and throw her out of the
window.&nbsp; But aside from the fact that she appeared to be
vigorous and of a fighting disposition he realized that the less
disturbance he made the greater chance he would have of carrying
through his mission successfully.&nbsp; It is not clear what the
outcome between the two would have been, if at that moment there
had not appeared from the inner office an elderly man whose mild
face had a worried look.&nbsp; Brainard noted the man&rsquo;s
near-sighted, timid air and regained his calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a young feller, Mr. Peters, who says
he&rsquo;s looking for Mr. Krutzmacht,&rdquo; the girl said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Krutzmacht is not in the city,&rdquo; the man said
nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know that!&rdquo; Brainard replied easily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You see I was sent here by Mr. Krutzmacht
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You come from Krutzmacht!&rdquo; the man gasped in
excitement, while the woman&rsquo;s face expressed
incredulity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where is he?&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve been
telegraphing all over the country the last week trying to locate
him.&nbsp; Mr. Snell has just gone east&mdash;left this office
only an hour ago&mdash;to see if he can find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard reflected that the Overland Limited had probably
served him a good turn by being <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>late; for he judged that the fewer
persons he had to deal with in the present emergency the easier
it would be for him to accomplish his purposes.&nbsp; This
mild-mannered, flustered clerk did not look formidable.&nbsp; His
tones gained confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Krutzmacht,&rdquo; Brainard explained glibly,
&ldquo;has met with an accident&mdash;not a serious one, I
hope.&nbsp; He is in good hands.&nbsp; He has sent me out here to
get some papers that he wants from his safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, but,&rdquo; the bewildered clerk stammered,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know that the court&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve fixed up a receivership, I know,&rdquo;
Brainard interrupted, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the reason
perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been expecting &rsquo;em in here all the
afternoon,&rdquo; the clerk said nervously, looking at the
door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then there&rsquo;ll be the devil to pay
generally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the better!&rdquo; Brainard exclaimed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get busy before they arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who are you, anyway?&rdquo; the old man demanded
with a sudden access of caution.</p>
<p>Brainard merely smiled at the worried old man.&nbsp; He was
more and more at his ease, now that he knew the caliber of the
timid old clerk, and though he felt the necessity of haste in his
operations, if an officer of the court was momentarily expected
<a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>to make a
descent upon Krutzmacht&rsquo;s private office, yet he spoke and
acted with calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we lock these outer doors&mdash;if you think
any one is likely to interrupt us&mdash;and then we can proceed
undisturbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shot the brass bolt in the door through which he had
entered and glanced into the inner office, but apparently this
one had no exit upon the corridor.&nbsp; Meanwhile the
stenographer was whispering vehemently to the old clerk, who
looked at the intruder doubtfully and seemed irresolute.&nbsp;
Brainard leisurely pulled down the shade over the glass window in
the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now we are
ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took the sheet that bore Krutzmacht&rsquo;s signature from
his pocket and held it out to Peters.&nbsp; &ldquo;Want my
credentials?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a power of attorney Mr.
Krutzmacht dictated and signed just before I left him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waited for the clerk to adjust his glasses and read the
hastily penned sheet, thinking what he should do if by chance the
old man refused to recognize it.&nbsp; He did not feel
disturbed.&nbsp; The ride across the continent had rested him
bodily and mentally.&nbsp; The good meals and the unwonted luxury
of eating and sleeping without care, which had been his daily
companion for all the years he could remember, had given <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>him a fresh
spirit.&nbsp; He could think quickly and with precision; he felt
himself amply capable, full of power to meet any emergency that
might rise&mdash;for the first time in his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want to do?&rdquo; Peters asked, handing
back the power of attorney.&nbsp; He seemed somewhat reassured by
the sight of his master&rsquo;s signature at the bottom of the
scrawl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Krutzmacht wanted me to get the stuff out of his
safe&mdash;I suppose it&rsquo;s the one in there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but,&rdquo; the clerk protested.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If the court has granted this injunction, I don&rsquo;t
suppose I ought to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just why you ought!&rdquo; Brainard
interrupted impatiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see this is
Krutzmacht&rsquo;s one chance of getting his property out of
their reach?&nbsp; Once the court puts hands on it, there
won&rsquo;t be much left for the owner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without further delay he strode into the inner office, saying
lightly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Krutzmacht is keeping out of sight for the
present&mdash;until trouble blows over, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The safe&rsquo;s locked,&rdquo; the clerk objected
weakly, &ldquo;and no one here has the combination.&nbsp; Mr.
Snell didn&rsquo;t leave it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without taking the trouble to reply, Brainard walked over to
the heavy steel door and began twirling the knob as if he had
opened office safes <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>all his life.&nbsp; The clerk and the stenographer
stared while the little nickel wheel revolved in Brainard&rsquo;s
fingers.&nbsp; When finally the bolts shot back and the door
swung open, Peters gasped:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how will you get all that stuff out of
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just bring me that bag from the other room, will you
please?&rdquo; Brainard asked the stenographer.&nbsp; As she
turned unwillingly to fetch the bag, there came a loud, resolute
knock at the door of the outer office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; the old clerk exclaimed.</p>
<p>The stenographer started for the door, but Brainard with one
leap overtook her, pushed her back into the inner room, and
closed the door.&nbsp; Again the knocking on the outside door
came, even more insistently, and the knob was rattled as if the
visitor was determined to gain entrance.&nbsp; The three in the
inner office stood still listening, not speaking.&nbsp; Brainard
noticed an angry red flush spread over the woman&rsquo;s
features.&nbsp; As no further knocking came after a few moments,
Brainard turned to the stenographer sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can sit at that desk, miss.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll answer
the door.&nbsp; Come on, Mr. Peters, and show me the most
important things in here&mdash;the papers Krutzmacht&rsquo;s
enemies would hate to lose.&nbsp; You know them, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>&ldquo;Some of them,&rdquo; the clerk admitted, rather
doubtfully, his eyes running over the close-packed shelves of the
vault.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re &rsquo;most all valuable in
here, I suppose.&nbsp; The general papers are kept in the other
vault downstairs.&nbsp; But the most important are in these
drawers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pulled out several receptacles that seemed crammed with
engraved certificates and legal papers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Krutzmacht kept all his personal papers up here
where he could get at them day or night,&rdquo; he
explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s all valuable to some
one!&rdquo; he concluded hopelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t put it all in that bag,&rdquo; Brainard
observed, his eye running over the contents of the well-filled
vault.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s try the drawers
first&mdash;the cream is likely to be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began to pass out the contents of the drawers to the clerk,
who shoved them hastily into the large valise.&nbsp; But before
Brainard had quite finished the second tier of drawers, the bag
was almost filled with crisp, tightly packed bundles of
securities and legal papers.&nbsp; There remained books and other
rows of documents.&nbsp; Brainard looked at some of them
impatiently, trying to decide what could best be left
behind.&nbsp; At last he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use my trying to pick it over.&nbsp; I <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>might leave
the best of the lot.&nbsp; I must have a small trunk.&nbsp; Can
you get me one, Peters?&nbsp; While you are gone I will fetch it
all out here and sort it over. . . .&nbsp; No, don&rsquo;t go out
that way!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as the clerk started for the outer
door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where does that go?&rdquo;&nbsp; He pointed to
a small door behind the corner of the safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the fire escape,&rdquo; Peters explained
timidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened the door and peered out into the dark, inclosed well
down which ran one of the modern circular fire escapes.</p>
<p>Brainard handed Peters a bill, and shoved him toward the
door.&nbsp; After the clerk had gone, Brainard turned to his
task, and emptied the safe in a few minutes.&nbsp; Then he began
to sort the books and papers and securities into piles for
convenient packing, stuffing the bonds and stocks, which he
judged to be the most valuable part of the loot, into his
valise.</p>
<p>There had been no movement by the stenographer for some time,
and Brainard had almost forgotten her presence.&nbsp; Suddenly,
while he was in the safe, he heard a slight sound outside, like
the movement of a woman&rsquo;s dress.&nbsp; He jumped to his
feet.&nbsp; The stenographer, with one hand on the desk
telephone, was about to take off the receiver.</p>
<p><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>&ldquo;Put that down!&rdquo; Brainard ordered, and added
more gently, &ldquo;What are you telephoning for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just going to call up a friend,&rdquo; the woman
replied pertly, and started to take the receiver off the hook
again.</p>
<p>Brainard cleared the intervening space in a bound, and
snatched the instrument from the woman&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to wait a while to talk to your
friend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here, anyway?&rdquo; she asked
angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can see&mdash;packing up some papers.&nbsp; You
might give me a hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; she replied without moving, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t believe that yarn you told old Peters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for one minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what will you do about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl tapped sullenly with her foot, without replying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to let that friend of yours know about me?&rdquo;
Brainard continued meaningly.&nbsp; As the stenographer tossed
her head and moved again toward the telephone, he added,
&ldquo;Come over here where I can watch you!&nbsp; Quick now,
pack those bundles into the bag.&rdquo;&nbsp; As she still
hesitated, defying <a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>him, he said sharply, &ldquo;Get down on your knees and
go to work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She whimpered, but fell to her knees.&nbsp; They worked
silently for several minutes.&nbsp; The vault was stripped
bare.&nbsp; The smaller papers were packed into the bag, and the
bulkier stuff was stacked on the floor, ready to be thrust into
another receptacle.</p>
<p>Brainard glanced at his watch.&nbsp; Peters had been gone more
than a quarter of an hour.&nbsp; Had he been detained, or had he
become suspicious and decided to get advice before going any
farther?&nbsp; Brainard considered departing with what he had
already packed in his bag, which he judged was the more important
part of the safe&rsquo;s contents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s about time for me to be going home
now,&rdquo; the stenographer remarked, plucking up her
courage.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave you and Mr. Peters to lock
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to see that friend badly, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; Brainard asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not quite yet; the
day&rsquo;s work is not over yet.&nbsp; Be patient!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not dare to trust her beyond his sight, nor did he
think it wise to leave her behind him.&nbsp; The girl walked idly
to the window, then edged along the wall.&nbsp; Beside the safe
there was a recess, from which the rear door opened.&nbsp; When
<a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>the
stenographer reached this, she, darted for the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by!&rdquo; she called.&nbsp; &ldquo;I guess the
police will take care of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little door fortunately stuck.&nbsp; Before she could open
it, Brainard had dragged her back into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just a common second-story man!&rdquo; she
cried angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly!&nbsp; How clever of you to penetrate my
disguise!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a car-barn bandit&mdash;Texas
Joe&mdash;anything you please!&nbsp; But before you skip, I want
you to look through those drawers in the vault, to see if I have
missed anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shoved the surprised woman into the empty vault, and swung
the door.&nbsp; As the bolts shot back into place, a muffled cry
escaped from within.&nbsp; Brainard called back:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save your breath!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s enough air in
there to keep you alive for some hours; and I&rsquo;ll see that
you get out in plenty of time to join that friend for
dinner.&nbsp; Just keep quiet and save your breath!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sob answered him from the vault.</p>
<h3><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>VIII</h3>
<p>At that moment a low, confidential knock came on the door of
the outer office, followed by a discreet rattling of the
knob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is at last!&rdquo; thought Brainard, with a
sense of relief.</p>
<p>He hurried to unbolt the door; but instead of Peters&rsquo;s
mild face, a chubby, spectacled young fellow, wearing his derby
hat pushed far back on a round, bald head, confronted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Brainard demanded, trying to close
the door.</p>
<p>The man grinned back:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had shoved his right leg into the opening, and with his
question he gave a powerful push that almost knocked Brainard
from his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said, once within the office, grinning
more broadly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Farson&mdash;Edward,
Jr.&mdash;from the <i>Despatch</i>.&nbsp; We just had a wire from
New York that Krutzmacht&rsquo;s been found, dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; Brainard exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had a stroke or something, and died this <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>morning in a
hospital.&nbsp; One of our old men down East got on to it, and
tipped us the wire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The intruder settled himself comfortably on the top of the
stenographer&rsquo;s little desk, and drew out a cigarette.&nbsp;
Dangling his fat legs, he eyed Brainard with an amused stare.</p>
<p>The latter stood for the moment dumfounded.&nbsp; Although he
had at first looked for this outcome, as the days had gone by he
had come to believe that the old man was recovering.&nbsp; Now he
realized swiftly that with Krutzmacht dead his power of attorney
was no better than a piece of blank paper.&nbsp; His position was
doubly tenuous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo;&nbsp; The reporter interrupted his
meditation in a burst of cynical confidence.&nbsp; &ldquo;The old
man was a good pirate&mdash;fought to the last ditch, and then
got out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think he got out?&rdquo; Brainard
inquired.</p>
<p>The reporter shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had him, and he must have known it.&nbsp; That
railroad crowd would have taken the hide off him, and put what
was left in the penitentiary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they made away with him,&rdquo; Brainard
suggested meaningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think so?&nbsp; My, that would be a fat
scoop!&nbsp; What makes you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard raised his eyebrows mysteriously, <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>and the
reporter nimbly filled in a reasonable outline of the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean he got the money down East that he needed to
stop this receivership, and they knew it, and put him out of the
way, so that he shouldn&rsquo;t interrupt the game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; Brainard admitted.</p>
<p>The reporter jumped from his seat briskly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
I must get busy&mdash;they&rsquo;re holding the paper for
me.&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s in charge here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Brainard replied promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pulled a dirty note book from his hip-pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wilkins,&rdquo; Brainard answered quickly, &ldquo;of
Wilkins &amp; Starbird, Mr. Krutzmacht&rsquo;s New York
attorneys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reporter looked at Brainard and whistled, but he wrote
down the name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You folks didn&rsquo;t lose any time in getting
busy!&nbsp; I s&rsquo;pose there&rsquo;ll be litigation and all
that.&nbsp; Do you expect to save much from the wreck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I am here for&mdash;to keep those
pirates from making off with the stuff!&rdquo;&nbsp; His eye fell
upon his valise, and a sudden resolution came to him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;See here, Farson,&rdquo; he said confidentially, laying a
hand on the reporter&rsquo;s pudgy thigh, &ldquo;do you see that
bag?&nbsp; The Pacific <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>Northern that they&rsquo;re after and
the Shasta Company are right inside that bag, together with a lot
of other valuable property.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to take it
where those pirates can&rsquo;t lay a finger on it, in spite of
all the courts in California!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reporter&rsquo;s eyes grew round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got your nerve!&rdquo; he said
admiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, time&rsquo;s money&mdash;big money.&nbsp; So I
can&rsquo;t stay here all night gassing with you.&nbsp; There is
a train on the Santa F&eacute; at ten, isn&rsquo;t
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten ten,&rdquo; the reporter corrected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must make that train, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lose the trick?&rdquo; the reporter suggested
affably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need some help in the get-away, I
suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so!&nbsp; If I make that train all right with this
stuff, there&rsquo;ll be a couple of hundred dollars for you, my
boy; and what&rsquo;s more, you can have the story all to
yourself.&nbsp; It will be better than the old man&rsquo;s
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pleasant smile circled around the reporter&rsquo;s chubby
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Mr. Wilkins!&nbsp; What do you want
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sent out for another bag,&rdquo; Brainard <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just pass the rest of
these papers out to you, and you can stack them ready to pack
when the bag comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard opened the inner door and listened.&nbsp; There were
faint sounds like sobbing within the safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she can cry, she&rsquo;ll last,&rdquo; he said to
himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now for it!&nbsp; Where in thunder can that
fellow Peters be?&nbsp; I hope he hasn&rsquo;t heard that the old
man is dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began to shove the books and papers through the door, which
he kept nearly closed, for fear that the reporter might detect
the sounds that came from the safe, and ask questions.&nbsp; It
was dark now, but he did not dare to turn on the electric lights,
for the windows faced the street, and he feared men might already
be watching the office.</p>
<p>He had transferred all the packages not packed, and was
struggling at his heavy valise, when he heard a voice behind him,
and started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you thought I was never coming back,&rdquo;
Peters stammered breathlessly.&nbsp; He was dragging a small
trunk through the little back door behind the safe.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It nearly broke my back getting this thing up those five
flights of stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring it this way, Peters!&rdquo; Brainard shouted
nervously, pushing the old man through the door into the outer
office.</p>
<p><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>He
banged the door shut just as a muffled scream issued from the
safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Peters asked, dropping the
trunk to the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody in the hall, I suppose,&rdquo; Brainard
replied coolly.</p>
<p>Fortunately the old man&rsquo;s attention was distracted from
the scream by the sight of the reporter.&nbsp; Farson had lighted
another cigarette, and was swinging his legs and smiling
amiably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t expect to see me, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right.&nbsp; Your friend here seems to
be in a hurry.&nbsp; He asked me to stay and help in the spring
moving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, get to work!&rdquo; Brainard called out, on his
knees before the trunk.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cigars and explanations
afterward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They slung the books and the packages of papers, which the
reporter had neatly arranged, into the little trunk.&nbsp; Then
they closed and locked it.&nbsp; Brainard unbolted the outer
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t make my exit by the front door,&rdquo;
the reporter advised.&nbsp; &ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;d be
spotted before you got to the street.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a back
way, ain&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard, thinking of the woman in the safe, hesitated.</p>
<p><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how I brought up the trunk,&rdquo;
Peters said.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nobody out
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard opened the door to the inner office, and
listened.&nbsp; It was quite still.&nbsp; Probably the woman had
fainted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; he called, grasping one end of the
trunk.</p>
<p>The reporter caught hold of the other, and Peters followed,
tugging at the heavy bag.&nbsp; As they crossed the inner office,
there was not a sound.</p>
<p>Brainard hesitated at the door, thinking that he must release
the girl before he left; but as he stood before the safe, there
was a squeal from within which indicated sufficient liveliness on
the part of the stenographer.&nbsp; There would be time enough to
attend to her after he had got his loot to the street.&nbsp; If
she were released now, her temper might prove to be troublesome;
so he joined the others on the landing, closing the little door
behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old man used to get out this way sometimes,&rdquo;
Peters observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon he never will again,&rdquo; the reporter
laughed.</p>
<p>The hall opened on a narrow, circular iron staircase, without
a single light.&nbsp; Down this pit Brainard and the reporter
plunged, tugging at <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>the trunk, which threatened to stick at every
turn.&nbsp; The old man got on more easily with the bag, which he
merely allowed to slide after him.&nbsp; Brainard was soaked in
perspiration; the reporter puffed and swore, but he stuck
manfully at his job.</p>
<p>At last they tumbled out into the dark alley at the rear of
the building.&nbsp; After he had caught his breath, Brainard
inquired where he could find a cab.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were you, young man,&rdquo; the reporter replied,
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t try being a swell.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d take
the first rig I could charter.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s one over there
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed down the alley, and waded off into the dark.&nbsp;
Presently he returned with a plumber&rsquo;s wagon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says he&rsquo;ll land your baggage at the ferry for
four bits.&nbsp; You can ride or walk behind, just as you
like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They loaded the trunk and the bag into the wagon, and the
reporter, perching himself beside the driver, announced
genially:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you aboard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much time is there left?&rdquo; Brainard asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty-two minutes&mdash;you can do it easily in
twenty-five.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>&ldquo;Wait a minute, then!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard took Peters to one side, and said to him in a low
voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember that noise you heard up there in the
office?&nbsp; It came from the girl&mdash;the stenographer.&nbsp;
She got fresh while you were out, and I had to lock her up in the
safe to keep her quiet.&nbsp; I think there is enough air to last
her some time yet; but her last squeal was rather faint.&nbsp;
Suppose you run up and let her out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peters, with a scared look on his face, made one bound for the
stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on, man!&rdquo; Brainard shouted after him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know the combination.&nbsp; Here it
is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He searched in his pockets for the slip of paper on which he
had copied the figures, but in the dark he could not find it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t any automobile,&rdquo; the reporter
suggested.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better put off your good-bys
until the next time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try to remember what I say,&rdquo; Brainard said to the
frightened Peters, and began repeating the combination from
memory.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure that&rsquo;s
right.&nbsp; Say it over!&nbsp; There, again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shaking man repeated the figures three or four times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&nbsp; Keep saying it over to yourself as <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>you go
upstairs, and I&rsquo;ll telephone the office from the ferry and
see if you&rsquo;ve got her out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Peters had already disappeared into the darkness within
the building.&nbsp; Brainard climbed into the plumber&rsquo;s
wagon, the man whipped up his horse, and they jolted out of the
alley.&nbsp; As they came in sight of the ferry building, the
reporter compared his watch with the clock, and remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight minutes to the good&mdash;fast traveling for a
plumber!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just look out for my stuff while I telephone!&rdquo;
Brainard exclaimed.</p>
<p>All the way to the ferry he had been anxious about the girl in
the safe.&nbsp; He had already resolved that if he found Peters
had failed to open the safe, he would go back and run the risk of
capture.</p>
<p>When the operator rang up the number of Krutzmacht&rsquo;s
private office, there was an agonizing wait before any one
answered.&nbsp; Finally a woman&rsquo;s voice, very faint,
called:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prudence counseled Brainard to assume that the voice was that
of the stenographer, and to hang up the receiver.&nbsp; But he
wished to make sure that it was the woman herself, and so he
asked:</p>
<p><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>&ldquo;Are you feeling all right, miss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thief!&rdquo; came hissing over the wire to his
ear.&nbsp; &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t get&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; And
there was no more.</p>
<p>She had dropped the receiver, probably for action.&nbsp; When
Brainard stepped from the telephone booth, he looked uneasily in
the direction of Market Street, as if he expected to see the
stenographer flying through the hurrying crowd.&nbsp; The
reporter beckoned to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your trunk has gone aboard the ferry.&nbsp;
Here&rsquo;s the check&mdash;to Chicago.&nbsp; I thought
you&rsquo;d rather tote this bag yourself, though it&rsquo;s
pretty heavy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much obliged for all your trouble,&rdquo; Brainard
replied warmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pulled his roll of currency from his pocket, and handed
five hundred-dollar bills to the reporter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You earned it!&nbsp; I never should have got away in
time without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s so.&nbsp; Much obliged for the
dough; but the scoop alone is worth it.&nbsp; What a story!&nbsp;
A light-fingered attorney from New York blowing in here under the
court&rsquo;s nose and lifting the whole Pacific Northern, and
goodness knows what else besides, clean out of the State!&nbsp;
Some folks who think they know how to do things will be sick
to-morrow morning when they get the <i>Despatch</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>He
shoved the bills into his trousers pocket and pulled out another
cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the gong!&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; Brainard said warmly, shaking the
reporter&rsquo;s fat hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll want to see
your story.&nbsp; Send it to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And say, I&rsquo;d make up a better yarn than that
lawyer story, when you have time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you didn&rsquo;t believe me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m no cub reporter!&rdquo; the
<i>Despatch</i> man laughed complacently, as the ferry-boat began
to move out of the slip.</p>
<p>Then he started on a run for the nearest telephone booth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that girl means business, as I think she does, I
shan&rsquo;t get as far as Chicago!&rdquo; Brainard muttered to
himself, turning into the cabin of the ferry-boat.</p>
<h3><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>IX</h3>
<p>When Brainard awoke the next morning the train was moving
through the Mojave desert.&nbsp; He lay for some time in his
berth trying to collect himself and realize all that had brought
him thither.&nbsp; It was intensely hot in the narrow compartment
that he had taken, and when he raised the window curtains the
sunlight reflected from the desert was blinding.&nbsp; As he drew
down the curtain, his eyes fell upon the large bag beside him,
and with a start the adventure of the previous day came over
him.&nbsp; He laughed aloud as he recalled the different scenes
in Krutzmacht&rsquo;s office,&mdash;the stenographer&rsquo;s
suspicious reception, the endless bumping down the circular iron
stairs with the bag and the valise, old Peters&rsquo;s horrified
face when he learned that the woman had been shut in the
safe.&nbsp; Indeed, the entire week since he ran across the dying
stranger at the door of his lodging seemed like a dream, peopled
with faces and scenes that were extraordinarily vivid and of a
kind he had never known in his narrow, sordid life.&nbsp; With a
luxurious sense of new possession he went over all the little
details of his journey <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>across the continent.&nbsp; The week,
he recognized, had been a liberal education to his mentally
starved self.&nbsp; But what was he going to do now?</p>
<p>Hitherto he had been carried along easily on a wave of events
that demanded instant action, and he had not worried about the
future.&nbsp; Even when the reporter had given him the news of
Krutzmacht&rsquo;s death in the hospital he was already too deep
in the affair to stop, although he realized that the crude power
of attorney, which had been his sole legal protection in looting
the safe, had lost all its force the instant its maker ceased to
breathe.&nbsp; After that, he was, as the stenographer had
said,&mdash;merely a burglar.&nbsp; Yet he had not hesitated to
obey the dead man&rsquo;s will rather than the law.&nbsp; But
now?</p>
<p>Thus far he had been executing Krutzmacht&rsquo;s direct
orders, with an unconscious sense of a living personality guiding
him, taking the real responsibility for his deeds.&nbsp; The
stranger who had been stricken near his door had seized upon him
as the nearest available tool, had imposed on him his will, and
had sent him hurrying across the continent on an errand the full
nature of which was even yet a mystery to Brainard.&nbsp; And he
had obeyed the dying stranger with a curious faith in his
reasonableness,&mdash;had responded to him pliantly as to the
command of a natural <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>master.&nbsp; But now that this
master was dead, the situation was altogether different.&nbsp;
Should he still attempt to execute his scarcely intelligible
wishes?</p>
<p>He had learned enough about Krutzmacht these last few days to
understand that the old man had been engaged in a life-and-death
struggle for the control of large properties,&mdash;one of those
peculiarly modern duels fought with bankers&rsquo; credits and
court decrees.&nbsp; Apparently his enemies, more powerful than
he&mdash;at least with larger resources at their
command&mdash;had been closing in on him for the final grapple,
which threatened utterly to ruin him.&nbsp; He had gone to New
York to raise the funds with which to evade impending bankruptcy
and loss of control of the properties which he had created.&nbsp;
Brainard now fully believed that Krutzmacht had succeeded in
this, and that he had been stricken at last by the hand of a
hired thug and thrown on the street to die.&nbsp; But even in the
torture of his final convulsions the old man had exerted his
powerful will to defeat these cowardly foes, and had lingered on
in life just long enough to enable his agent to snatch the prey
from their jaws.</p>
<p>What now was he to do with this bag of documents and
securities that lay there, its fat sides bulging in proof of his
deed?&nbsp; The obvious thing <a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>would be to seek the nearest federal
authority, deposit his plunder, and allow an impartial court to
settle the dispute between the dead man and his enemies.&nbsp; A
week before, such a timid and safe course of conduct would have
seemed to Brainard the only possible action to take.&nbsp; Now he
found it not in the least to his taste, and dismissed it without
further consideration.&nbsp; He had become an altogether
different person, even in this week, from that beaten man who had
stumbled homeward from a petty defeat through the New York
streets in the gloom of an April day.&nbsp; For this one brief
week in all the years he could remember he had been
alive&mdash;fully alive&mdash;and with his hand now in the thick
of this vital web he was not willing to withdraw.&nbsp; The one
who had used him as a tool was dead, but his strong will lived on
in him, not yet fulfilled, and to that strong will whose only
hope of fulfillment lay in him&mdash;the chance stranger&mdash;a
new sense of loyalty responded.&nbsp; He would not desert the old
man in the present crisis, no matter what the merely legal
aspects of his situation were.&nbsp; Already the stranger&rsquo;s
will like fertile seed was germinating within this fresh
soil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take everything,&rdquo; Krutzmacht said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Take it all to Berlin.&rdquo;&nbsp; That he would do if he
could.</p>
<p><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>But
then what?</p>
<p>There was a strange name&mdash;Mell or Melody&mdash;that the
dying man had been at such pains to enunciate.&nbsp; What had
Melody to do with the matter?&nbsp; Was it the name of a
person?&nbsp; Or an institution?&nbsp; He exercised all his
ingenuity in trying to invent a reasonable explanation of this
one word.&nbsp; Possibly Krutzmacht had tried to pronounce Mendel
or Mendelssohn.&nbsp; Brainard thought there was a firm of German
bankers with some such name.&nbsp; Light on the puzzle might be
found in the contents of his bag, but at present he did not like
to open it.&nbsp; At any rate Berlin must be his next
destination.</p>
<p>He pondered all these things at his late breakfast, where in
the close-shaded car electric fans buzzed to make a semblance of
moving air.&nbsp; The fellow travelers on this
train&mdash;returning tourists from Southern California
resorts&mdash;did not interest him as had the varied company on
the Overland, and he shut himself up in his compartment with his
secret, not even leaving it for luncheon.&nbsp; It seemed that
already the cares of property&mdash;even of another, unknown
person&rsquo;s property&mdash;were beginning to separate him from
his fellows, rendering him less eager to make acquaintances, more
suspicious than he was by nature.&nbsp; In the present
circumstances he preferred <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>to keep to himself.&nbsp; So all that
long day, alone in his hot room, he thought, while the train
slowly traversed the mighty Arizona plains, arid, limitless,
austere, broken here and there by solitary rocky peaks that rose
majestically out of the desert into the still, clear
atmosphere.&nbsp; It was a stranger land than he had ever
dreamed, outside all the world that he knew, remote, mysterious,
calm.</p>
<p>He did not open the bag for fear of possible
interruption.&nbsp; He thought, and as the hot day wore on into
the afternoon he began to lose that sense of security he had had
when he caught the train in San Francisco.&nbsp; The burden of
the bag became heavier.&nbsp; If he were any judge of newspaper
men, that reporter Farson had by this time spread the story of
his deeds broadcast over the civilized world.&nbsp; Messages
might be speeding past him even now on the wires, directions to
intercept his flight at some convenient point farther to the
east.&nbsp; He first planned to make for New Orleans as a port of
departure for Europe, having altogether abandoned the idea of
returning to New York, which probably was the one most dangerous
spot for him on the globe.&nbsp; Even New Orleans seemed a
desperately long way off.&nbsp; The sooner, he reasoned, he could
put an international boundary between himself and
Krutzmacht&rsquo;s <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>enemies, the better would be his chance of reaching
Berlin with his plunder.</p>
<p>He examined the crude map in the railroad folder and made out
that by the next noon, if the train were on time, he could make
connections at Albuquerque in New Mexico with a train for El
Paso.&nbsp; To-morrow noon seemed far off, but he concluded that
it was the best he could do.&nbsp; Until then he should have to
run his chances, and possess himself with patience.&nbsp; The day
drew slowly to its conclusion.&nbsp; The sun streamed more
horizontally across the arid plain, touching the distant
mountains with blood-red tints.&nbsp; A desolate, man-forsaken
country!&nbsp; For miles and miles there was not a living being,
not a habitation in sight from the railroad.&nbsp; Somewhere far
off beyond those purpling mountains lay the romantic land of
Mexico, which seemed the proper haven for any kind of
lawlessness.&nbsp; Fortunately he was abundantly supplied with
ready money.&nbsp; In addition to the large sum he had found in
the old wallet he had come across in one of the inner drawers of
the safe a canvas bag of gold coin, placed there no doubt by the
thrifty German for some emergency such as this when it might not
be convenient to get money from a bank.&nbsp; So he had on his
person very nearly ten thousand dollars in gold and bills, which
ought to suffice <a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>for an extended journey.&nbsp; Ready money gave the
young man a comfortable sense of security that he had never
hitherto experienced for any length of time. . . .</p>
<p>At a division headquarters where the train was changing
engines, Brainard with his head out of the window was gazing
interestedly at the motley crowd of plainsmen, greasers, and
blanketed Indians.&nbsp; The door of his compartment was
brusquely thrown open and one of the trainmen demanded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard jumped back from the window, replying mechanically,
&ldquo;Edgar Brainard&mdash;why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be scared, stranger!&rdquo; the official
replied with a chuckle at Brainard&rsquo;s startled look.&nbsp;
He glanced through his spectacles at a yellow envelope.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m lookin&rsquo; for a party named Wilky or
Wilkins.&nbsp; You ain&rsquo;t the feller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard stepped forward to take the telegram, but the man had
already turned away.&nbsp; It flashed over Brainard at once that
probably Farson was trying to communicate with him, using the
foolish name he had given the reporter half in jest.&nbsp; The
friendly newspaper man, grateful for the liberal gift he had
received, was perhaps trying to warn him of some possible
danger.&nbsp; It was too late now to get possession of the
telegram.&nbsp; <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>The conductor was passing through the car, asking the
passengers their names and exhibiting the yellow envelope.</p>
<p>For the next hour Brainard sat with his nerves on edge, his
mind keenly alert to some impending danger.&nbsp; Suddenly the
train drew up with a forcible application of the emergency brakes
that brought the passengers to their feet.&nbsp; All the men in
the car streamed out to the vestibules, and Brainard among them,
to see what had happened.</p>
<h3><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>X</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Only a bridge gone,&rdquo; was the word disgustedly
handed back from mouth to mouth.&nbsp; There had been an unusual
fall of rain in the arid country to the north, and for a few
hours one of the <i>arroyos</i> had become a boiling flood, which
had swept away a substantial new bridge.&nbsp; The passengers
straggled forward to the scene of trouble.</p>
<p>In the curious half light of the sun sinking into the desert
behind and illuminating all the vast high plain with a brilliant
reddish light, the huddle of passengers along the right of way
and the stalled cars seemed singularly out of place, accentuating
the desolate loneliness of the country, where for miles and miles
as far as the eye could reach nothing was to be seen rising above
the sagebrush and cactus except a range of misty, purple
mountains a few miles to the south and a huge water tank a mile
or two in the rear.&nbsp; On either side of the petty stream that
had already subsided to its normal shallow condition several
trains had been caught and held by the loss of the bridge, the
Eastern Limited being the last to join the confusion.&nbsp; The
passengers on these various trains <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>had mingled along the right of way
and were watching the efforts of a large gang of laborers to
build a temporary track across the gully, which was almost
completed.&nbsp; Some of the passengers had been there since
early morning, and these greeted the newcomers from the Limited
with joking inquiries about the state of the larder on their
train.&nbsp; It was a good hundred miles in either direction to
any station possessing a lunch counter, and the question of
supper was becoming of serious importance to the less fortunate
travelers.&nbsp; As Brainard talked with some of these passengers
from the East, he was given a newspaper brought on the last
train.&nbsp; It was the Sunday morning <i>Albuquerque
Star</i>.&nbsp; Brainard drew to one side and scanned its pages
by the fading light.&nbsp; It did not take long for him to find
what he was seeking.&nbsp; On the front page of the first
section, in the place of honor, there was an associated press
dispatch from San Francisco, describing the sensational robbery
in the office of a prominent business man.&nbsp; It told without
material exaggeration the events of the afternoon before; there
was no hint that the affair was more than a daring, but common
burglary by a reckless and experienced hand.&nbsp; Brainard
rather resented this aspect of the story.&nbsp; In conclusion it
said that the authorities had strong clews and expected to lay
their hands on the <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>robber before he would have any chance to dispose of the
more valuable part of his haul.&nbsp; Brainard handed the paper
back to its owner, chatted for a few moments longer about their
common predicament, then strolled thoughtfully back the way he
had come.</p>
<p>His was almost the last car of the three trains on the
westerly side of the <i>arroyo</i>, and as he picked his way
beside the track he could hear the few elderly ladies that had
not left their seats talking about the delay.&nbsp; It amused him
to think what they would say, if they knew that their quiet,
well-dressed fellow traveler was the hero of the tale he had just
read in the <i>Albuquerque Star</i>.&nbsp; There was a peaceful
calm here in the rear, for even the porters and the train hands
had gone forward to watch the operations of the laborers.&nbsp;
The engines puffed slumberously; there was an intense stillness
in the air; the sun had just disappeared, leaving a dull red glow
in its place.</p>
<p>It was perfectly evident to Brainard that he could not hope to
reach Albuquerque without arrest; he must leave the train at the
next station of any size, but even that was extremely
risky.&nbsp; With searching eyes he examined the country, which
was now sinking imperceptibly into the vagueness of dusk.&nbsp;
There was nothing for miles in any direction for the eye to rest
upon but <a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>cactus and forlorn sagebrush, except that lonely water
tank in the rear.&nbsp; There were the mountains, to be sure, but
they were many miles away, and he knew that he could never reach
them alone with his bag, even if he were sure that he could find
a refuge in them.&nbsp; No, it would be suicidal to attempt an
escape in this desert!&nbsp; Whatever came, he must run the risk
of waiting until the train stopped at some more favorable
place.&nbsp; He had come to this conclusion, standing beside the
rear platform of the last car, where he could get an
uninterrupted view of the vast landscape and was about to seek
the seclusion of his own little room, when his eye caught sight
of an object in the cactus not far from the track.&nbsp; He soon
made out the moving figure of a small horse and a rider, and
waited with curiosity to see what sort of person would appear in
this desolate country.</p>
<p>The horse dropped to a walk, then halted altogether, as if
timid, but soon approached at a slow walk.&nbsp; As far as
Brainard could see, the figure was that of a young girl, riding
astride a rough yellow pony.&nbsp; The pony crawled within a few
yards of the cars, then refused to go farther in spite of its
rider&rsquo;s efforts with a quirt to overcome his fear.&nbsp;
Brainard walked down the track nearer them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evenin&rsquo;, stranger,&rdquo; the girl called
out.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all the trouble he-ar?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>&ldquo;Bridge gone,&rdquo; Brainard replied
succinctly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Live around here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A ways back, up yonder!&rdquo;&nbsp; The girl hitched a
shoulder in the direction of the south.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Live in the water tank?&rdquo; he queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon I don&rsquo;t, stranger,&rdquo; came back in
the severe tones of a child whose dignity has been ruffled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then where can you live on this desert&mdash;is there a
town concealed anywhere abouts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer from the figure on the pony was a pleasant girlish
laugh, and then in the soft, southern tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon, stranger, you won&rsquo;t find much of a
to-own this side of Phoenix&mdash;and that&rsquo;s a mighty long
ways from he-ar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time Brainard and the pony had come sufficiently near
together so that he could make out the small straight
figure.&nbsp; The girl could not be over fourteen, he judged; she
was thin and slight, with dark skin and small features concealed
beneath the flap of an old felt hat.&nbsp; She wore a faded khaki
skirt and leather leggings.&nbsp; In her small bony hand dangled
a heavy man&rsquo;s quirt with which she swished the ground, and
at times she looked up shyly at the &ldquo;stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where you from?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;New York,&rdquo; Brainard replied.</p>
<p><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>&ldquo;New York!&rdquo; she repeated with an accent of
wonder and surprise.&nbsp; &ldquo;That must be a mighty big
ta-own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather more populous than this&mdash;what do you call
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They call the siding back there by the tank
Phantom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phantom&mdash;is that because it&rsquo;s only a
mirage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say. . . .&nbsp; Where be you
going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mexico!&rdquo; Brainard hazarded at a venture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mexico!&rdquo; the girl drawled.&nbsp; &ldquo;That must
be a sight farther off than Phoenix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to Mexico for, stranger?&rdquo; the
girl persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mining business,&rdquo; Brainard fabricated glibly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Copper or gold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All kinds, my child,&rdquo; Brainard replied
flippantly.</p>
<p>The girl drew herself up with considerable dignity, and
remarking,&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m agoin&rsquo; to see what they
all be doin&rsquo; down yonder,&rdquo; stirred up the yellow pony
and rode off in the direction of the <i>arroyo</i>.&nbsp; She
drew up a few rods from the center of activity and stood there in
the twilight.&nbsp; Brainard was sorry for his foolish answer
that had apparently frightened her away.&nbsp; He went <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>back to his
compartment, and after a few moments&rsquo; thought grasped his
valise and got off the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she can live in this country, I guess I can,&rdquo;
he muttered to himself.</p>
<p>He flung his bag down in the sagebrush and sat on it, waiting
until the girl came back.&nbsp; Presently there was a series of
jubilant toots from the engine of the first train as a signal of
the successful reopening of traffic; then the east-bound trains
began slowly to move one by one down into the gully over the
temporary track.&nbsp; When the last train had crept by him
Brainard rose and sauntered in the direction of the girl.&nbsp;
She was still sitting motionless on her pony, absorbed in the
spectacle of all these moving trains,&mdash;a peculiarly lonely
little figure, there in the gathering dusk of the desert,
watching as it were the procession of civilization pass by her. .
. .&nbsp; After the eastbound trains had got away and were
steaming off towards the horizon, the west-bound trains began to
file across the break, having picked up the wrecking crew and
their equipment.&nbsp; The girl did not move.&nbsp; Evidently in
her life this was a rare treat, and she did not mean to lose any
part of it.&nbsp; So Brainard waited until the red rear lamps of
the last train shone out by the water tank, and then as the girl
slowly turned her pony <a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>back he rose from the ground and
hailed her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pony shied at Brainard, but the girl easily reined it
in.&nbsp; She did not seem much discomposed by the sight of
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost your train, stranger?&rdquo; she observed with
admirable equanimity.&nbsp; &ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be no more
along &rsquo;fore to-morrow morning, I reckon,&rdquo; she
added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I want a train,&rdquo; he
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo; to Mexico on foot with that trunk?&rdquo;
she asked.&nbsp; He detected a mirthful note in her voice.&nbsp;
Evidently she took neither him nor his pretended mining business
with great seriousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I&rsquo;m going to try to
do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you won&rsquo;t get there to-night, I
reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose not.&nbsp; Can you tell me some place where I
could spend the night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the water tank,&rdquo; she suggested,
with a little laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there somebody where you come
from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl shook her head quite positively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be some one in this God-forsaken country who
would take a stranger in!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care about spending
the night out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl laughed as if it were all a great joke.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be nobody to hurt you,
stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>She
started on her road.&nbsp; Brainard thought he was in for a night
in the open and cursed his folly in jumping off into the
desert.&nbsp; But the girl pulled up after a few steps, and he
could hear her gay chuckle as she called out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sure did want to stay in Arizona bad&mdash;you lost
six trains!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That mining business must be very important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something else is,&rdquo; he said boldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it very bad, what made you want to get to
Mexico&mdash;a killing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as bad as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t understand, I am afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might try tellin&rsquo; of me, all the
same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t anything bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They all say that,&rdquo; she suggested mockingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m merely trying to carry out some one&rsquo;s
orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl looked mystified, and after a moment&rsquo;s further
thought remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s old man Gunnison.&nbsp; He might take you
in for the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does he live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back a ways up the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you show me the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>&ldquo;I might,&rdquo; she admitted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Better
give me that trunk,&rdquo; she said, pointing to the bag.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You would sure be tired if you toted that all the way to
Gunnison&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl slipped from the pony and expertly made the bag fast
to the saddle with the thongs.&nbsp; Then taking the reins, which
she drew over the animal&rsquo;s head, she strode out into the
darkness.&nbsp; Brainard stumbled on after his guide as best he
could.&nbsp; Presently when he became more accustomed to the dark
and to progress over the uneven ground he joined the girl and
tried to make her talk.&nbsp; She developed shyness, however, and
replied only briefly to his questions.&nbsp; She lived somewhere
up in the mountains towards which they were traveling and which
could be dimly perceived ahead, a soft, dark barrier rising in
the night.&nbsp; But what she did there, who her people were, she
would not say.&nbsp; In spite of her youth and her inexperience
she had a shrewd child&rsquo;s wit that could turn off
inconvenient curiosity.&nbsp; Although she drawled and spoke the
slovenly language of uneducated people, there was something about
her, perhaps her instinctive reserve, that bespoke a better
breeding than her clothes and her speech indicated.&nbsp; She did
not make further inquiries about Brainard&rsquo;s business; he
surmised that she refrained because she thought <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>him to be
some kind of a wrongdoer.&nbsp; He wanted to explain to her his
erratic conduct, but he realized that it would be not only
foolish but almost impossible to make clear to her limited mind
just what the situation with him was.&nbsp; So for minutes there
was silence between them while they plodded on.</p>
<p>Brainard liked the girl, felt a strange sort of pity for her,
an unreasoned pity for a forlorn and lonely child, who he
instinctively divined was sensitive and perhaps unhappy in spite
of her flippant speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you doing down there at the railroad?&rdquo;
he asked in another attempt to start conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she replied vaguely,
&ldquo;nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing!&nbsp; It must be a long way from your home to
the railroad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It takes three hours to ride it,&rdquo; she
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you ride down there often just to look at the
trains go by?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Most every week, stranger,&rdquo; she said
softly.</p>
<p>Brainard whistled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could feel her toss her head.&nbsp; Her answer was
vague.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; somewheres.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you want to go on them?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>&ldquo;Perhaps. . . .&nbsp; I expect I shall some
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she sighed,
&ldquo;anywheres&mdash;California, maybe,&mdash;New
York&mdash;somewheres I can live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The energy with which she uttered these last words had
something pathetic in it.&nbsp; As if to avoid further
confession, she urged the tired pony to a shambling trot and
Brainard again found difficulty in keeping the pace.&nbsp; After
another half hour of this blind progress behind his taciturn
guide, the girl stopped before what seemed to be a mound of dirt
and remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Gunnison&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Maybe the old man
is abed&mdash;I&rsquo;ll raise him for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She proceeded to pound vigorously with the butt of her quirt
on the door of the dugout.&nbsp; Presently there was a sound
within, and a human head appeared at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a gentleman who wants to go to some place
in Mexico,&rdquo; the girl said in her gentle Southern
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;I told him it was pretty fur from these
parts, but I reckon you know how to git there, if any one
does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you put me up for the night, anyway?&rdquo;
Brainard asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the first
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can do that,&rdquo; the sleepy Mr. Gunnison replied
after a time, coming out of the door.&nbsp; &ldquo;But if you be
in a hurry to reach Mexico, stranger, <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>you&rsquo;d better go back to the
railroad you come from, and take the next train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about that in the morning,&rdquo;
Brainard replied.</p>
<p>The girl had already unfastened the bag and mounted her
pony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much obliged to you, miss, for all your
help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, stranger,&rdquo; she said
cheerily, starting the pony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going home now?&rdquo; Brainard asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This childish figure, astride the tired pony, riding back into
the lonely mountains, seemed to him extremely pathetic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by!&rdquo; he called after her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hope
we shall meet again some day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon we might, stranger!&rdquo; came back to him in
the soft voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps in New York?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye-as&mdash;or in Mexico.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the pony&rsquo;s feet padded rapidly off into the
darkness, and the girl was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is she&mdash;do you know?&rdquo; he asked the
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belongs over in Moniment, in one of them mining camps,
I expect,&rdquo; the old man replied indifferently.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I seen her riding past this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>&ldquo;Where is she going alone at night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno&mdash;guess she knows her own
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a small girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They know how to look after themselves, in these parts,
as soon as they can creep,&rdquo; the old man remarked
calmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;They have to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monument!&rdquo; Brainard repeated to himself,
wondering where he had heard that name before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they call it.&nbsp; It ain&rsquo;t
much of a place now.&nbsp; There used to be a big mine near
there, but it ain&rsquo;t been worked in years. . . .&nbsp; You
can come right in and bunk alongside of me, stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>XI</h3>
<p>Brainard did not follow the old plainsman&rsquo;s advice to
stick to the railroad for his travels.&nbsp; Instead, he induced
Gunnison to leave his dugout and guide his chance guest across
the Mexican border.</p>
<p>It was not as easy as it looks on the map in the railroad
folder to get from Phantom, Arizona&mdash;which was the name of
the water tank where he had dropped from the train&mdash;into the
State of Chihuahua; but Brainard did not feel pressed for
time.&nbsp; Indeed he judged it might be as well for him to
remain out of all possible contact with civilized centers for
several weeks, to &ldquo;let things settle down,&rdquo; as he
phrased it.&nbsp; Pursuit would naturally relax after the first
unsuccessful attempts and would probably concentrate upon New
York where it might be supposed that he would ultimately turn
up.&nbsp; Moreover, every day of delay made it less likely that
some observing busybody would recall the sensational newspaper
story and identify him and his bag with the description of the
robber who had left San Francisco on the evening of April
26.&nbsp; Gunnison asked no <a name="page98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>questions.&nbsp; The virtue of
reticence, Brainard found, was admirably cultivated in these
sparsely habited parts of the earth.&nbsp; The old man seemed to
have no pressing duties to recall him to his dugout, and so they
followed the trail leisurely, making a few miles each day and
occasionally stopping for a day or two to rest while Gunnison
procured supplies from one of the small mining towns.</p>
<p>Those weeks on the trail with old Gunnison and the pack train
of two horses and a mule were full of joy to the city-bred man,
who had rarely escaped the pavements.&nbsp; The high altitudes,
the vivid desert colors, the beauty and the savage wildness of
this little-known part of the world filled him with ecstatic
happiness as well as abounding health.&nbsp; He became hard and
rugged, losing the pallor of the city man and all the petty
physical weakness that had contributed largely to his fits of
depression.&nbsp; Health made a new man of him in mind as well as
in body.&nbsp; He hardly recognized himself when he awoke in the
morning.&nbsp; Never before had he known what it was to be
heartily in love with life, thoroughly vital, eager to act, to
plan, to embrace the struggle of living; so light and free from
distressing doubts, so willing to test what destiny held in store
for him!&nbsp; Just as the exciting events of his sudden journey
and his hours in Krutzmacht&rsquo;s office had <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>awakened his
will and his self-reliance, so these weeks of wandering free
through the desert and the mountains were the best sort of
preparation for a strong, active manhood.&nbsp; Fortunately they
had come to him before it was too late, before his character had
finally settled into its groove, and new powers were evoked in
him, even physical possibilities, that he might never have
suspected to be his.</p>
<p>The nights under the glittering cover of the Arizona heavens,
the long days of peaceful activity in the sunlight, the silence
and the majesty of these vast desert spaces appealed to him
strongly, satisfied that love of beauty and of mystery that had
been crushed hitherto.&nbsp; Lying awake beneath the stars, his
head pillowed on his bag, which had rapidly lost its suspicious
appearance of newness, he speculated upon much that had never
before entered his head.&nbsp; And his feeling about Krutzmacht
and the accident that had brought them together changed.&nbsp; It
was no longer a mere wild jaunt, something unreal, like an
adventure in piracy.&nbsp; It was part of the great enfolding
mystery of the universe that had touched him and enlisted his
life.&nbsp; It seemed that he had embarked upon a mission that
must end in a great experience.</p>
<p>At this time of life, with the blood flowing <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>actively
through his body, his mind awake to all the voices of the earth,
it was but natural that woman should enter into the affair.&nbsp;
Krutzmacht&rsquo;s last mumbled word,&mdash;that dubious
&ldquo;Melody,&rdquo;&mdash;served him as point of departure for
romantic dreams.&nbsp; Forgetting altogether his reasonable
hypothesis that it might prove to be the name of some firm of
German bankers he assumed that &ldquo;Melody&rdquo; must be the
name of a woman.&nbsp; A queer name, doubtless, especially for
one in any way connected with the old German, who seemed to have
no affinity for fine art or even womanhood, other than the common
stenographer of his office.&nbsp; Nevertheless, in obedience to
the desire of his heart, Brainard created a person to fit the
name, and thought of Melody as a woman.</p>
<p>From this his thoughts wandered occasionally to the little
girl who had guided him to old Gunnison&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He saw her
slight, wistful figure as she stood motionless watching the
procession of trains, heard her soft voice and gurgling
laugh.&nbsp; He resolved to return some day to this wonderful
country, his mission fulfilled, and discover that abandoned
mining town of Monument, and find there the little girl on the
pony who had come to his rescue in the darkness.&nbsp; He had
probed old Gunnison for more exact information about the girl,
but either he knew nothing more than that <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>&ldquo;she
belonged up Moniment way&rdquo; or did not care to tell what he
knew.</p>
<p>On other matters he was more communicative.&nbsp; He had been
long in the country, knew it in the old days before it had been
invaded by railroads and large mining companies.&nbsp; He had
prospected from the Colorado River south to Chihuahua in old
Mexico.&nbsp; He had driven cattle from Texas to Nebraska, and
latterly worked on the railroad.&nbsp; He knew Indians,
&ldquo;greasers,&rdquo; miners, cowboys, and for hour after hour
he talked of what he had seen &ldquo;before it got so dern
ceevilized in these parts.&rdquo;&nbsp; In other words, before
there was a railroad line two hundred miles to the east and
another three or four hundred miles west!&nbsp; He knew where to
camp and where supplies could be got without arousing undue
curiosity.&nbsp; He knew horses and mules and men.&nbsp; And he
taught the young man some of these useful things that he knew so
that when they parted in the city of Guadalajara Brainard felt
more grateful to him than to any one of the regular instructors
of youth, who had given him his so-called
&ldquo;education.&rdquo;&nbsp; He paid him liberally for his
services, and the old man, sticking the bills beneath the band of
his felt hat, made a few final remarks to his patron:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where you come from, my
son,&mdash;hain&rsquo;t asked yer, and I don&rsquo; want to
know.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve <a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>treated me right, and I&rsquo;ve
treated you right.&nbsp; I guess if you keep free of cards, and
drink, and women, and keep on agoin&rsquo; due saouth,
you&rsquo;ll likely strike the City of Mexico, before you be much
older, and keep your belongin&rsquo;s with yer,&rdquo; he added,
smiling upon the bag that Brainard had so carefully guarded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll try the railroad for a
change,&rdquo; Brainard laughed back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quicker&mdash;sometimes,&rdquo; the old man
admitted, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t find too many troublesome
persons traveling the same way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this last hint he waved farewell and started northwards
for the States.</p>
<h3><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>XII</h3>
<p>The next day Brainard entered the City of Mexico, lean and
brown and hard, with a very much travel-stained valise.&nbsp; So
far as he could learn from the few American newspapers he had
come across, there had been no further excitement over
Krutzmacht&rsquo;s death, and the robbery of his safe.&nbsp; If a
pursuit had been undertaken, the fact had been carefully kept
from the press; and he felt confident that by this time either it
had been given up, or the persons interested were watching the
wrong places.</p>
<p>There was a steamer sailing for Havre from Vera Cruz sometime
towards the end of the month, and he resolved to take it,
meanwhile resting and making a few preparations for his
voyage.&nbsp; It was the first time in his life that he had been
outside his own country, and every sight and sound in this
bastard Spanish metropolis filled him with curiosity and
pleasure.&nbsp; He secured his cabin on the <i>Toulouse</i>, and
then set out to do the sights.</p>
<p>The second evening, as he was resting after a busy day in the
cool courtyard of the old Hotel Iturbide, a little man in a
bedraggled linen duster <a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>hitched his chair across the stones
toward Brainard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just come down from the States?&rdquo; he
inquired.&nbsp; Brainard nodded.</p>
<p>With this slight encouragement, the stranger launched forth
upon a rambling talk about himself.&nbsp; He had come to Mexico,
several years before, to manage a rubber-planting enterprise, and
the &ldquo;dirty dagoes&rdquo; had done him out of his last
cent.&nbsp; Soon he proposed having a drink with his compatriot,
&ldquo;in honor of the greatest country in God&rsquo;s
world.&rdquo;&nbsp; When Brainard refused, saying that he was
tired and was going to bed, the American shambled along by his
side through the corridors.</p>
<p>Judging that his fellow countryman was a harmless dead-beat,
Brainard put his hand into his pocket, and drew forth a bill, as
the easiest way of ridding himself of an unwelcome
companion.&nbsp; At sight of the money, the man&rsquo;s eyes
filled with tears.&nbsp; Taking his benefactor&rsquo;s arm, he
poured forth a flood of personal confession and thanks that
lasted until they were at the door of Brainard&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me come in and talk to you a minute,&rdquo; the
stranger begged.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t often I see a decent
man from God&rsquo;s country, and I get lonely down here,&rdquo;
he whimpered.</p>
<p><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Brainard replied reluctantly,
wondering how he could rid himself of the fellow.</p>
<p>When he turned on the electric light, the stranger&rsquo;s
eyes roamed carelessly over the room.&nbsp; It seemed to Brainard
that his guest exhibited much more keenness than his forlorn and
lachrymose state warranted.</p>
<p>As Brainard turned to the wardrobe to fetch a box of cigars,
he caught the man&rsquo;s eyes fastened on the valise which was
shoved under the bed.&nbsp; Brainard gave him a cigar, but did
not invite him to sit down, and after a little while he left,
thanking Brainard profusely for his hospitality.&nbsp; As he went
out of the door, his eyes rested once more on the bag beneath the
bed.</p>
<p>After his visitor had left, Brainard prepared to
undress.&nbsp; First he placed his watch and pocketbook on the
night table.&nbsp; Over them he laid his revolver, which he had
purchased in his wanderings, and, under Gunnison&rsquo;s
directions, had learned to use.&nbsp; Now that he was outside the
States, whoever might dispute with him the possession of
Krutzmacht&rsquo;s property would have to make good his
demands.&nbsp; He had lost every trace of that nervous fear which
had made miserable the day after his departure from San
Francisco.</p>
<p>Before turning out his light, he glanced into the courtyard,
and caught sight of his recent <a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>acquaintance skulking behind a
pillar.&nbsp; For several minutes Brainard stood behind his
curtain, looking into the courtyard, and in all this time the man
did not move from his post.</p>
<p>There was no reason, Brainard said to himself, why this
dead-beat should not spend the night in the courtyard of the
Hotel Iturbide.&nbsp; Turning out the light, he got into bed; but
he could not sleep, and presently he rose and peered cautiously
out into the dark.&nbsp; The courtyard, faintly lighted by the
lamps in the office, was empty.&nbsp; This disturbed him rather
more than the skulking presence of the American, although he
could give no reason for his suspicion beyond the
stranger&rsquo;s apparent interest in his valise.</p>
<p>He got back into bed, but not to sleep.&nbsp; After tossing
restlessly for another hour, he rose and dressed.&nbsp; As soon
as the first light appeared, he took his bag and groped his way
through the dark corridors to the office.&nbsp; He inquired of
the night porter about trains and found that there was an early
morning train to the North.&nbsp; Saying that he had had a bad
night and thought he would go to the railroad station and wait
there for the train, he paid his bill, not forgetting to add a
good tip.&nbsp; The man offered to get him a cab, but he refused,
saying that he could easily pick up one in the street.&nbsp; As
the porter who had been roused to <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>something like animation by his
<i>pour boire</i> unbarred the great door, Brainard asked him
casually:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know that <i>Gringo</i> who was talking to me
last evening&mdash;the one who was hanging about here all the
evening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <i>se&ntilde;or</i>,&rdquo; the man replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been in and out at the hotel for a week.&nbsp;
Just come from the States, and lost all his money at cards so
soon.&nbsp; A bad lot!&rdquo; with a final shrug of the
shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me he had been here several years!&rdquo;
Brainard exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <i>se&ntilde;or</i>, that cannot be.&nbsp; He knows
no Spanish.&nbsp; Probably he wished money from you to go back to
the States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely&mdash;well, he didn&rsquo;t get
much!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a short walk Brainard came out upon the plaza in front
of the cathedral.&nbsp; The cracked bells of that great edifice
were clanging inharmoniously for the early mass.&nbsp; Already
country people had arrived with market produce, and there was
considerable stir in the beautiful May morning.&nbsp; Brainard
walked about the plaza until he found an old, muddy diligence
drawn by four little mules that was about to start for some
village of an unpronounceable Indian name.&nbsp; Brainard took a
place inside and waited for it to fill with passengers.&nbsp; At
last the driver climbed into his perch, <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>and the
diligence rattled off through the square over the stone streets
just as the sun was rising into a clear sky.&nbsp; A regiment of
<i>rurales</i> came galloping down the narrow street, with its
band playing a lively air.&nbsp; The diligence pulled to one
side, then turned off towards the west, and soon it was out in
the flowering fields of the great plateau.&nbsp; As he left the
city pavements, Brainard smiled to himself at the disappointment
his acquaintance of the night before might be having at the
railroad station.&nbsp; Of course, he might be nothing worse than
a stranded dead-beat anxious to sponge a few dollars from a
good-natured compatriot who appeared to be in funds.</p>
<p>But Brainard would take no chances!&nbsp; If the contents of
his battered valise were as valuable as he thought they must be,
the persons interested in securing them would spare no effort or
expense in tracking him.&nbsp; Although he had grown brown from
the sun and much stouter and had discarded his spectacles, still
it would not be difficult for a good detective to identify him
from a description furnished by the stenographer.</p>
<p>And if this fellow were really after him, it was not likely
that he was alone.&nbsp; So it was important that he should find
some small place where he could spend the remaining days before
the departure of the French line boat.&nbsp; It was a pity <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>that the
diligence he had chosen at random should apparently be making in
the opposite direction from Vera Cruz.&nbsp; But the morning was
too brilliant, and Brainard&rsquo;s nerves were too sound to let
anything worry him.&nbsp; Thus, with the few words of Spanish
which he had acquired while he was with old Gunnison, he launched
himself again gayly upon the unknown in Mexico.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world is full of ways,&rdquo; he said to
himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;All you have to do is to take
one!&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>XIII</h3>
<p>If there was a spot on the round earth where a somewhat weary
fugitive might spend a few quiet days in absolute retirement,
undisturbed by inquisitive intruders, it must surely be the
little Mexican town of Jalapa.&nbsp; Situated on a gentle hill
not far from the snowy dome of Orizaba, about midway between the
hot coast and the lofty central plateau, Jalapa is a mass of
green verdure and possesses a delightful climate.&nbsp; All about
on the slopes of Orizaba and in the green valleys are extensive
coffee plantations, watered by delightful streams.&nbsp;
Everywhere great umbrageous trees, tropical in their luxuriance,
shade the approaches to the old town.&nbsp; Jalapa itself
consists of a few streets of white buildings with irregular tile
roofs, a squat cathedral of the Spanish-American type, fertile
green gardens carefully walled in, and of course a plaza, which
at this season of the year was abloom with fragrant lilies.</p>
<p>To Brainard, after a week of circuitous wandering through
Mexican villages, sleeping and eating in filthy places, it seemed
a veritable oasis.&nbsp; As <a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>the mule cart in which he had
completed the last part of his erratic journey slowly dragged him
up the shady hill, he had visions of a good bath and a day or two
of complete idleness before moving on to Vera Cruz, to take the
boat for Havre.&nbsp; His clothes sadly needed attention, and he
was uncomfortably aware that in addition to a useful acquaintance
with the Spanish language he had also acquired a miscellaneous
assortment of vermin from his recent wandering.&nbsp; The
somnolent streets in the hot May afternoon were nearly deserted,
so that his arrival in the town aroused little attention.&nbsp;
As the mule cart drew up in the courtyard of a clean-looking
hotel next to the cathedral and opposite the pretty plaza, he
congratulated himself thoroughly on his luck.&nbsp; Having seen
his bag deposited carefully in one of the enormous bedrooms that
faced the plaza, and accomplished the desired bath, he descended
to the patio on an exploring expedition.&nbsp; Near the trickling
fountain in the center of the <i>patio</i> a well-dressed man was
seated, reading a book.&nbsp; Brainard instinctively felt that he
must be an American from the appearance of his clothes, although
his face was hidden by the book.&nbsp; On the small iron table by
his side an iced drink was standing.&nbsp; The stranger reached
for this and dropped his book long enough to perceive
Brainard.</p>
<p><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he said calmly, &ldquo;when did
you arrive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard recognized the fight-trust magnate whom he had met on
the Overland Limited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You here too!&rdquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
brings you down here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hollinger sipped his drink and eyed the young man as though to
say,&mdash;&ldquo;we don&rsquo;t ask that sort of question in
these parts&mdash;it is very crude of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, business and pleasure,&mdash;that combination which
carries us mortals most everywhere,&rdquo; he observed and with a
slight stress added,&mdash;&ldquo;the same I judge that brought
you to Mexico.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; Brainard laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t say how much is business and how much
pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And possibly a dash of&mdash;something else?&rdquo;
Hollinger suggested genially.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s have
another drink on it.&nbsp; <i>Mozo</i>! . . .&nbsp; A southern
gentleman who resides in Jalapa has taught these people how to
make his favorite form of booze.&nbsp; It is cooled by snow
brought from the mountains on mule back&mdash;and is very
refreshing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the waiter had brought two high glasses filled with the
crystal flakes of snow, the fight-trust magnate grew more
expansive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, shortly after I had the pleasure of making your
acquaintance I found the climate of <a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>California uncongenial to my nerves,
for the first time in my life, and having business interests in
Mexico I took a little vacation.&nbsp; Delightful time of the
year here, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard agreed enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t make a long stay with us on the
Coast,&rdquo; Hollinger remarked, with the shadow of a
smile.&nbsp; Brainard knew that the fight-trust man suspected his
story, but judged it wiser to avoid personal confidences.&nbsp;
For this reason he refrained from inquiring whether the
American&rsquo;s business had to do with some notable encounter
that was to be staged in Mexico in order to avoid the laws in the
States.&nbsp; Hollinger&rsquo;s next remark seemed to indicate
that such was his &ldquo;business interest&rdquo; in this
country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are apt to look down upon Mexico,&rdquo; he said
sententiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it is a great country.&nbsp; We
say that it is not civilized.&nbsp; That is just why it is a
great country.&nbsp; It is not civilized in our peculiar, narrow
way, and hence we deny that it has any civilization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly has fleas,&rdquo; Brainard threw in
flippantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly, young man&mdash;it has fleas and therefore you
think it is barbarous.&nbsp; You have been brought up among a
people that regards cleanliness as above godliness and the other
fellow&rsquo;s <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>godliness of more importance than his own!&nbsp; That
is what is called Puritanism.&nbsp; You understand me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard nodded.&nbsp; He began to comprehend the results of
Hollinger&rsquo;s reading on the Overland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; continued Hollinger, clearing his throat,
&ldquo;I have nothing to say against Puritanism.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
a very good thing for some people.&nbsp; It did some mighty fine
work in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Discovered Plymouth Rock, for instance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and created the nicest lot of little hypocritical
tight-wads there in New England the world has ever seen.&nbsp; We
needed those tight-wads out west&mdash;we needed their bank
accounts, I mean to say.&nbsp; But we don&rsquo;t need &rsquo;em
any longer, only they can&rsquo;t understand it and keep shoving
their morals in our faces.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the trouble with
America all over at the present date.&nbsp; Puritanism breaks out
here, there, and everywhere, like the measles.&nbsp; And it
always means trying to make the other feller as good as you think
he oughter be&mdash;and a damn sight better than you are
yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused to send for another drink.&nbsp; Brainard wondered
what the august author of the great epic would have thought of
this twentieth century criticism of his theory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now Mexico is free from all that sort of cant, and that
is why I said Mexico was destined to be a <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>great
country.&nbsp; In Mexico they let the individual alone.&nbsp; You
see, the Church is supposed to look after the morals of the
community.&nbsp; That is a great relief&mdash;it simplifies life
and makes it much more honest.&nbsp; The Church does the best it
can, and the State helps it out when necessary.&nbsp; But the
Church don&rsquo;t expect too much, the Catholic Church I mean,
of human beings, and so it isn&rsquo;t disappointed.&nbsp; It all
works beautifully!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll never find in Mexico such a
fool performance as that going on in San Francisco to-day.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;re no puritans in California either.&nbsp; They
don&rsquo;t want reform&mdash;they don&rsquo;t want to shut up
the caf&eacute;s and French restaurants and prevent the city
council from getting its little rakeoff&mdash;not a bit of
it!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s only this puritan bug has got hold of some
&lsquo;better than thous&rsquo; among us, and they are raising
hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused to finish his drink and wipe his brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It always heats me to think,&rdquo; he explained.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I was saying that for this reason Mexico has a great
part to play in the future.&nbsp; For one thing, it furnishes us
Americans a possible place to live in when our own country has
one of these righteous attacks and is cleaning house.&nbsp;
Lovely country, lovely climate, lovely people&mdash;if you know
how to handle &rsquo;em right.&nbsp; No, sir, I hope
they&rsquo;ll never civilize Mexico in my time any more <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>than it is
civilized at present.&nbsp; The natural man needs a country, and
Mexico is his country. . . .&nbsp; Come on&mdash;let&rsquo;s have
a look at the town.&nbsp; The band will be playing in the square
a little later, and you will see some of the prettiest girls you
ever saw in your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fight-trust man lighted another cigar, put on his panama
hat, and tucked an arm under Brainard&rsquo;s elbow, and thus
they sallied forth to explore Jalapa.&nbsp; Brainard might not
agree with his friend&rsquo;s anti-puritanism, but he heartily
agreed with his praise of Mexico.&nbsp; At this gentle hour of
the late afternoon soft rosy clouds hovered about the white head
of old Orizaba.&nbsp; The gardens, glimpses of which might be
caught through iron-barred gates, were fragrant with flowering
trees, in which the birds sang madly.&nbsp; After a short ramble
about the outskirts of the town, they returned to the plaza,
which was now fairly filled with men and women and children,
gathered to hear the military band and to enjoy the fragrant
coolness of the dying day.&nbsp; Many of the brown <i>peon</i>
girls were pretty, and the Spanish women, pallid and
black-haired, with white mantillas, quite fascinated the young
American.&nbsp; A fountain shot a lively jet of water into the
sunlight.&nbsp; The great white lilies drooped their golden
chalices under shining leaves.&nbsp; The band of Indians at the
other end of <a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>the square played operatic music that came through the
soft air languorously in harmony with the atmosphere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where in America, the land of the puritan, can you get
so much for your money?&rdquo; Hollinger demanded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is only in the lands of license that the people delight
in innocent things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flung a copper coin to a beggar woman, who crossed herself
and blessed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is even pleasant to give to the beggars, instead of
subscribing to an orphan asylum!&nbsp; We make virtue so dull and
inhuman.&rdquo; . . .</p>
<p>As they strolled towards the hotel for dinner, they were
joined by a tall, lean, lank fellow countryman, whom Hollinger
introduced to Brainard as Major Calloway,&mdash;&ldquo;from
Alabama, superintendent of the Jalapa-Vera Cruz branch of the
railroad.&rdquo;&nbsp; The three dined together in the
<i>patio</i> with a young German, who was the agent for a firm of
coffee merchants in Hamburg.&nbsp; They had an extraordinary
Mexican dinner, consisting of the most fiery condiments that
Brainard had ever put into his mouth.&nbsp; His eyes were
constantly watering, and he drank quantities of water, much to
the amusement of the others, who swallowed the pungent food with
relish.&nbsp; They sat for a long time over their coffee and some
very black cigars that Calloway produced, listening to the
stories <a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>the Southerner told.&nbsp; It seemed that he had been
in the country forty years, in fact ever since the close of the
Civil War, in which Calloway had gained his title.&nbsp; Until
recently the railroad had been but a mule tramway and Jalapa not
even a &ldquo;spot on the map.&rdquo;&nbsp; He regarded it now as
a metropolis.&nbsp; Mexico according to this old resident was
hopelessly tame and civilized under the firm rule of Diaz and the
influx of money-making Americans and Germans.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
should have seen it in the old days when a man could live as he
liked.&nbsp; Why, they have even got extradition laws for most
things now,&rdquo; he complained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they don&rsquo;t use &rsquo;em,&rdquo; the
fight-trust man put in suavely.</p>
<p>Listening to the regrets expressed by the railroad manager,
Brainard perceived that the perfect era of freedom and joy was
always somewhat removed from the present time and place.&nbsp;
Calloway was most friendly to the young American.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show your young friend one of the old-time
places to-morrow.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t far from here&mdash;just a
pleasant ride of a couple of hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So a party was arranged for the early morning, and then
Brainard excused himself because of his fatigue, while the others
went out to a caf&eacute; for the rest of the evening.</p>
<p>Before sinking into his clean, inviting bed <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>Brainard
stepped to the balcony to look once more at the snowy crown of
Orizaba that shone softly in the starlight across the
valley.&nbsp; The plaza and the street beneath the balcony were
deserted except for an occasional figure that slouched along,
covered even to the head with a long cloak.&nbsp; At the next
corner he saw a young man leaning against the window of a house,
talking to some one within, doing his courting in the manner of
the country.&nbsp; A sharp call rose into the night from the
distance, answered by another, and then all was silence.&nbsp;
From the plaza across the street came the sweet scent of
lilies.&nbsp; It was the rich, languorous night of the
semitropics, full of perfume and mystery,&mdash;romance for
youth,&mdash;a bit crude, perhaps, and elementary, but appealing
to every sense.</p>
<p>Brainard sank asleep to dream of a land of enchantment, full
of hidden gardens, the sound of swaying trees and falling water,
the scent of lilies, the sweet glances of dark women.</p>
<h3><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>XIV</h3>
<p>Very early the next morning after the usual deep cup of
chocolate Brainard joined Hollinger and Major Calloway, and the
little party set forth on horseback.&nbsp; They rode through the
silent town, between high walls jealously guarding the privacy of
large gardens, out into the fields which were drenched with a
heavy dew like rain.&nbsp; The birds sang in the arching trees
above the road.&nbsp; The sun came up from a golden mist in the
lowlands below and touched the hoary crest of Orizaba.&nbsp;
Brainard had never seen such an incarnation of spring upon the
earth as this glorious May morning, and his heart sang joyously,
free of care, forgetful of the burden of his heavy bag and all
the coil of events that had brought him hither.&nbsp; Like a
schoolboy he was resolved to have his holiday.&nbsp; The lively
chestnut horse with which Calloway had mounted him danced
mincingly, chafing at the heavy bit.&nbsp; The magnate of the
fight trust in a short jacket and leather breeches, a broad straw
sombrero on his head, a long black cigar in his mouth, had the
appearance of a bull fighter on parade.&nbsp; He too seemed gay
in mood, and called <a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>Brainard&rsquo;s attention to the
richness of the land, the varied specimens of tropical trees
beneath which they rode, the beauty of the landscape, always
dominated by the symmetrical snow-crowned mountain.&nbsp;
Calloway and the German took the expedition more phlegmatically,
discussing the prospects of the new coffee yield.</p>
<p>From the shaded hill road they emerged upon a fertile valley
where the <i>peons</i> were already at work in the fields.&nbsp;
And they also began to meet the country population moving towards
Jalapa for the weekly fair.&nbsp; Hollinger, who seemed to have a
fair command of Spanish, joked with men and women along the
road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t do that in the States!&rdquo; he
remarked to Brainard.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;d just give you a
couple of sour looks and vote for no license.&rdquo; . . .</p>
<p>The little party rode up to the Ha&ccedil;ienda di Rosas in
time for the second breakfast.&nbsp; The old Englishman seemed
delighted to welcome Calloway&rsquo;s friends and presented them
to his placid Mexican wife and his two daughters.&nbsp; The
younger of these fell to Brainard at the breakfast, which was
served in the cool <i>patio</i> shaded by a thick canopy of rose
vines.&nbsp; Se&ntilde;orita Marie was very small, very pretty,
and very na&iuml;ve,&mdash;just home from a convent near Madrid,
she told the young American.&nbsp; She spoke English daintily, <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>mixed
occasionally with French and Spanish phrases and some very modern
American slang whose meaning she seemed scarcely to
understand.&nbsp; She was so unlike the few American girls that
Brainard had known, so little able &ldquo;to look out for
herself&rdquo; as they were, so appealing with shy glances from
her black eyes, that from the first moment he scarce remembered
where he was or heard the conversation at the other end of the
table.&nbsp; She was exquisitely small and dainty, like one of
those Spanish beauties by Goya that Brainard had seen in the
Metropolitan Museum.&nbsp; Her black hair was drawn close about
her delicate head, concealing her ears and setting off the
fairness of her skin, which had an underglow of faint rose.&nbsp;
Her voice was a murmur and a whisper, at times like broken bird
notes, as if meant for one ear alone.&nbsp; They talked of the
nothings that mean much to youth.&nbsp; She told him of her life
in the convent, her one winter in the City of Mexico with its
formal parties, her brother studying to be an engineer in a New
York school.</p>
<p>After the siesta they went into the plantation, and Brainard
lingered while the others drifted on discussing the culture of
coffee and its future.&nbsp; Se&ntilde;orita Marie showed him her
favorite walk with a view of Orizaba across the valley, told him
that her favorite poet was Tennyson, the flower <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>she loved
best was the rose, the time of the year spring, the time of the
day twilight.&nbsp; And she asked him if he had brothers and
sisters and was a good Catholic.&nbsp; The time might come, and
shortly perhaps, when the childishness of this little mind would
be apparent to Brainard, but on this heavenly May afternoon with
the birds singing in the thickets and lazy white clouds floating
across the snowy summit of the volcano, their talk seemed quite
wonderful and the girl herself the most exquisite and adorable
creature he had ever known.</p>
<p>&ldquo;American girls do not talk like that, no?&rdquo; she
murmured, appealing to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but you see it&rsquo;s different down here&mdash;we
have only little things to think about, we women, all day
long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very pleasant down here,&rdquo; the young
American sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You like it?&rdquo; she responded eagerly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But you would not like it for always. . . .&nbsp; You
American men are like that.&nbsp; You come to see the plantation
and drink coffee and talk&mdash;maybe you flirt a little,
no?&mdash;and then you ride away and say you will write.&nbsp;
But you never write, and you never come back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall write, and I shall come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>The
small lady shook her head with a demure smile.&nbsp; They
returned slowly through the fields.&nbsp; Yes, this girl was
utterly different from the women of his own race, and her
difference appealed to him.&nbsp; She seemed, even in her
simplicity, more womanly, more as women were meant to be, the
protected and the adored.&nbsp; His imagination built up a pretty
picture of a dreamy existence in a beautiful country with such a
trusting, simple, lovable creature as companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you go away so soon?&rdquo; she demanded as they
neared the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must take the boat for Europe,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be another boat in a month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like me to stay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know that?&rdquo; . .
.&nbsp; Calloway and Hollinger were already on horse-back in the
courtyard, about to start without him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you coming with us?&rdquo; the fight-trust man
asked with an ironical smile.</p>
<p>The Englishman and his wife gave the young stranger a cordial
invitation to remain and make a long visit.&nbsp; Brainard was
about to accept when he remembered his bag left unguarded in the
hotel room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall have to return to the hotel for
to-night,&rdquo; he said reluctantly.</p>
<p><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll drive over for you and your
luggage to-morrow,&rdquo; the Englishman insisted cordially.</p>
<p>And Se&ntilde;orita Marie whispered demurely, &ldquo;Au
revoir&mdash;there&rsquo;s another steamer&mdash;in a
month!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Brainard rode off with the others, very much pleased with
himself and life, lightly putting aside his settled purpose of
taking the <i>Toulouse</i> two days hence.&nbsp; What urgent
reason for haste, when life was so full of promise and of
beauty?&nbsp; Another month would do as well for
Krutzmacht&rsquo;s business. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see much of the plantation,&rdquo; the
Southerner drawled to Brainard as the young man&rsquo;s horse
drew up abreast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He saw a great deal of something more to his
liking,&rdquo; Hollinger observed, a little ironical smile on his
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a very good day,&rdquo; Brainard responded
simply, wishing to avoid further reference to the girl.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The daylight quickly faded, and before they reached the hill
on which Jalapa lies, the moon was up, flooding the valley and
the mountains.&nbsp; Calloway became confidential, and for the
first time told the full story of their recent host.&nbsp; Years
before, the Englishman had arrived in Mexico and bought this
plantation.&nbsp; He was a young man then <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>and
single.&nbsp; He never went home.&nbsp; It seems that he had
absconded from a shipping firm in Liverpool where he was employed
and had taken ten thousand pounds.&nbsp; Later he married a
Mexican woman of good family and had prospered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he never leaves the country.&nbsp; The woman and
the girls go&mdash;the son is being educated in the
States&mdash;but the old man has never been beyond the
line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be hard on them&mdash;the girls,&rdquo;
Brainard said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do they care?&nbsp; Harlow is rich and respected
in this country.&nbsp; The women are Mexican, though the girls
have been well educated.&nbsp; It was a long time ago when he
took the money, and as you see he lives like a perfect gentleman
with his own wife and family.&nbsp; There are a good many
citizens here who have better antecedents than Harlow and
aren&rsquo;t as respectable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked suddenly at Brainard.&nbsp; The young man did not
reply.&nbsp; He was thinking that even if the Englishman had been
a thief, there was no reason why he should not like the
daughter,&mdash;yes, and visit the Ha&ccedil;ienda di Rosas, if
he so desired!&nbsp; He supposed that Calloway had told him
Harlow&rsquo;s story for a purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After you have lived here awhile,&rdquo; the Southerner
continued, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t ask questions about <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>newcomers,
so long as they play fair and don&rsquo;t try to borrow money of
you.&nbsp; Live and let live&mdash;that&rsquo;s a good motto,
young man.&nbsp; You never can tell when you will need the same
charity for yourself that you hand out to another
fellow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That philosophy seemed a bit specious, and Brainard felt an
instinctive repugnance to the morals of his new
acquaintances.&nbsp; He suspected that the Southerner might have
his own story, which would explain why he was living a lonely old
age so far from his native Alabama.&nbsp; Hollinger added nothing
to the conversation.&nbsp; It was a somewhat delicate subject
with him also.&nbsp; But all the young man&rsquo;s chivalry rose
in behalf of the little Mexican girl.&nbsp; This was the reason
why young Americans never wrote and never came back!&nbsp; Well,
he would show her that there was one who had the courage to
forget that her father was an embezzler.</p>
<p>When they reached the hotel Calloway said good night and went
to his room.&nbsp; Brainard was about to follow him when
Hollinger yawningly suggested having a drink of
<i>pulque</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever tried it?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not so bad; like the
sort of yeast mother used to make out of potatoes,&rdquo; and as
Brainard demurred, he said more urgently, &ldquo;Oh, come
on!&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re going to live on a Mexican
ha&ccedil;ienda, better get acquainted with the <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>national
drink&mdash;though that was pretty good claret the Englishman put
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went across the way to a caf&eacute; that was still open
and ordered <i>pulque</i>.&nbsp; Brainard, after tasting the
sirupy, yeasty stuff put his glass down with a grimace.&nbsp;
Hollinger drained his and ordered another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All you have to do with most things is to get used to
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; The question is,&rdquo; he added, looking
meaningly at Brainard, &ldquo;whether you want to get used to
&rsquo;em! . . .&nbsp; Young man,&rdquo; he remarked, as they
turned back to the hotel, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to butt into
your business&mdash;I am not that kind.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
whether you are traveling for your health, the same as I am, or
for some other fellow&rsquo;s health.&nbsp; But, in any
case,&mdash;&rdquo; here his voice became quietly emphatic,
&ldquo;all is, if you&rsquo;ve got a job to do, do it!&nbsp;
Whether it&rsquo;s cracking a safe or running a city mission, my
young friend, go at it and finish with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard threw up his head with all the haughtiness of the
young man who considers that he has thus far done very well
without outside assistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just cut out any woman business until the job&rsquo;s
done,&rdquo; Hollinger continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;Women are likely
to upset most business&mdash;they distract the mind, you
know.&nbsp; Pardon me for calling your attention to the fact that
you seem still young and <a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>somewhat inexperienced in life, in
spite of your achievements.&nbsp; Have you fully made up your
mind to join the exiles down here for good and all?&nbsp; Better
think it over first far away from the se&ntilde;orita&rsquo;s
eyes, out at sea. . . .&nbsp; Well, here endeth the first lesson,
and good night, and pleasant dreams!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night!&rdquo; Brainard replied stuffily.</p>
<p>The porter handed them both candles, and by way of
ingratiating himself with his generous patrons announced that two
more <i>gringos</i> had arrived late that afternoon.&nbsp;
Brainard, who was smarting under the fight-trust magnate&rsquo;s
moral advice, paid little attention to the servant&rsquo;s
chatter and went directly to his room.&nbsp; He undressed slowly,
thinking of the charming girl at the Ha&ccedil;ienda di Rosas and
the happy day he had spent with her.&nbsp; Hollinger&rsquo;s
frank warning to get to his &ldquo;job&rdquo; and let women alone
rankled all the more because he felt the good sense of it.&nbsp;
But something within him tempted him to rebel at good
sense.&nbsp; He was young, and he had been through a series of
strenuous weeks, living a lonely, rough life.&nbsp; There seemed
nothing unpardonably weak in allowing himself a bit of good time
here in this lovely place.&nbsp; Of course Hollinger&rsquo;s idea
that he would straightway marry the embezzler&rsquo;s daughter
and settle down in Jalapa for life was needlessly <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>exaggerated.&nbsp; Probably there would be another
steamer in less than a month.&nbsp; And so forth, as youth under
such circumstances reasons with itself!</p>
<p>Continuing this debate he went out to the balcony for a last
look at the beautiful moonlight night.&nbsp; He lingered there,
charmed by the stillness of the deserted streets, by the soft
scented air, by the beauty of the white peak towering into the
southern heavens.&nbsp; The pleasant murmur of the girl&rsquo;s
voice sounded in his ears.&nbsp; He was not in love, he said to
himself,&mdash;that would be quite ridiculous!&nbsp; But he was,
without knowing it, in a state where a young man soon thinks
himself into love.</p>
<p>All his experience since leaving New York led up, as a matter
of fact, to this very state.&nbsp; Se&ntilde;orita Marie need not
be so extraordinarily fascinating, nor Jalapa so wonderfully
picturesque, to set the stage for the eternal drama.&nbsp; He was
just repeating to himself one of the girl&rsquo;s na&iuml;ve
remarks when he became conscious of low voices above him.&nbsp;
English was being spoken, and by a woman.&nbsp; He remembered
what the porter had said about new arrivals at the hotel, and
strained his ears to hear what was said.&nbsp; But the speaker
was evidently seated within the room overhead, and her voice was
too low to reach out and down with <a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>any distinctness.&nbsp; There was
something in the timbre of it, or the accent, that seemed to
Brainard familiar,&mdash;perhaps nothing more than its
Americanism.&nbsp; A man&rsquo;s voice, rather guttural and
entirely unfamiliar, broke in on the woman&rsquo;s speech.&nbsp;
The man must be standing nearer the balcony, for Brainard could
hear distinctly what he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how Mossy let him slip through his
fingers in Mexico City, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>An unintelligible answer came from within the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, it was clear luck our stopping off here to send
that wire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then suddenly in perfectly distinct though low tones came
the sentence:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see the grip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard knew <i>that</i> voice!&nbsp; The pert, crisp twist
to the words might resemble a thousand other stenographers in
style, but he knew only one that hissed her final words
slightly.&nbsp; He held his breath and listened.&nbsp; The woman
came out on the balcony, and Brainard noiselessly glided back
into the shadow of his dark room.&nbsp; He had seen the profile
of the figure above and knew beyond doubt that she was
Krutzmacht&rsquo;s former stenographer.&nbsp; The man said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew which way he meant to <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>jump
next.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s just fool enough to go back
North.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get him, either way,&rdquo; the woman
replied with a snap and retreated into the room, closing the
French window.</p>
<h3><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>XV</h3>
<p>Brainard stood without moving until his muscles ached.&nbsp;
Then he dropped to the floor, crawled over to the bed, and felt
beneath the bolster, where he had taken the precaution to conceal
his bag when he had left that morning.&nbsp; It was still
there.&nbsp; The room had been casually searched, or possibly his
pursuers had only just arrived by a delayed train.</p>
<p>At any rate, he had until the next morning.&nbsp; The woman
and her companion would not be likely to make a disturbance that
night, feeling that they had him and his plunder safe within
grasp.&nbsp; They knew as well as he that all escape from Jalapa
was impossible before the early morning train for the
North.&nbsp; It must be said that from the moment Brainard first
heard the stenographer&rsquo;s voice, every thought of
Se&ntilde;orita Marie and of the Ha&ccedil;ienda di Rosas dropped
from his mind.&nbsp; Danger was a panacea for the early symptoms
of love!</p>
<p>While he thought, Brainard took off his shoes, tied them
together by the laces, and slung them around his neck, as he had
done as a boy, when he wished to make an early escape from the
parental <a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>house.&nbsp; Then, placing his precious bag on his
shoulders, he crept inch by inch toward the open window.&nbsp; It
was hazardous, but it was his only chance.&nbsp; He was morally
certain that he could not enter the hall without making
sufficient noise to attract attention.</p>
<p>When he reached the balcony, he listened.&nbsp; Not hearing
any sound from the next room, he stepped out into the moonlight,
and walked as rapidly as he could along the open balcony to the
corner of the building, and around to the other side.&nbsp; He
knew that the fight-trust man&rsquo;s room was somewhere in the
rear wing, and his plan was to make an exit through his
room.&nbsp; But the balcony did not extend to this wing, and he
was brought to a halt.&nbsp; He looked over the rail to the
street, thinking to drop his bag and follow it as best he
could.&nbsp; It was a good fifteen feet from the balcony to the
hard pavement beneath.&nbsp; As Brainard debated the chances of
breaking a leg, he saw approaching the spot the figure of a night
officer on his rounds.&nbsp; Instinctively he drew back, felt for
the nearest window, and pushed it open.&nbsp; He prayed that it
might be an empty room; but he was no sooner within than he heard
the loud snoring of a man.</p>
<p>Perplexed, Brainard listened for a few moments, then quietly
crossed to the bed.&nbsp; Feeling about <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>over the
night table, he secured the pistol that he suspected might lie
there, then boldly struck a match.&nbsp; With a snort, the
sleeper sat bolt upright.&nbsp; Luckily it was Calloway, the
manager of the railroad.&nbsp; Brainard whispered tensely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, but don&rsquo;t speak!&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s your gun&mdash;only don&rsquo;t shoot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; the Southerner demanded
coolly, now wide awake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said,&rdquo; Brainard whispered, &ldquo;that there
was always a time when a man might need charity.&nbsp; Well, I
want your help.&nbsp; I have a bag here that contains valuable
papers belonging to some other person.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m trying to
get them to a safe place, as I was told to.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t
stolen anything, you understand, but of course you won&rsquo;t
believe that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been followed here by some enemies
of the man who owned the stuff.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d kill me as
quickly as they would a fly to get possession of this bag.&nbsp;
If they can&rsquo;t murder me, and take it that way, they will
probably put me in prison to-morrow and keep me there.&nbsp; I
must get out of town to-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do that before to-morrow
morning,&rdquo; the Southerner replied, yawning, as if he wished
Brainard would take himself off to bed and let him alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must get out of this hotel now, to-night, and <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>away from
Jalapa, and not have a soul know where I&rsquo;ve gone.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll pay you well for your trouble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your money, my son,&rdquo; the man answered
gruffly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t for <i>that</i> I had to
come down here.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll help you out, if you are in
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reflected yawningly for a few moments, while Brainard held
his breath with impatience.&nbsp; For all he knew, the man and
the woman might already have entered his room and discovered his
flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it were daylight, it would be different, but you
know I couldn&rsquo;t start a train out of here at this time
without the whole town knowing about it; and I reckon that
isn&rsquo;t what you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you bunk here with me until morning?&nbsp;
Then Hollinger and I can fix up something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d run you down myself in an engine to the
coast&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there isn&rsquo;t an engine that can turn a wheel
in the place.&nbsp; The first train comes up in the
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might get a horse and go over to the
ha&ccedil;ienda,&rdquo; Brainard suggested.</p>
<p>The Southerner scratched his sleepy head for a while.</p>
<p><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>&ldquo;You might,&rdquo; he admitted.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
that wouldn&rsquo;t put you out of your trouble and might put
other folks into danger.&nbsp; You want to lose these urgent
friends of yours for good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got some nerve?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough to capture this stuff from a court and tote it
&rsquo;cross country from Frisco!&rdquo;&nbsp; He patted his
valise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, then!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Southerner drew on his trousers and boots.&nbsp; As
Brainard turned impatiently toward the door, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pulled back a hanging at the foot of his bed, revealing a
little wooden door, which he opened, and, candle in hand, led the
way through a close, dusty passage.&nbsp; After making several
turns, they descended a flight of narrow stairs, and
Brainard&rsquo;s guide pushed open a door at the bottom.&nbsp;
The musty odor of old incense told him that they had entered a
church, and the wavering candle-light partially revealed the
statues of the saints and the altars of the chapels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cathedral,&rdquo; the Southerner remarked, and
added, &ldquo;Convenient sometimes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard followed him closely across the nave of the church to
a door, which Calloway unbolted <a name="page138"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>after some fumbling.&nbsp; They
emerged upon a narrow lane with blank walls on either side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That hotel used to be the bishop&rsquo;s palace,&rdquo;
the Southerner explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pretty handy
place to get out of on the quiet, if you know the way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was only a short distance to the railroad terminal.&nbsp;
Calloway walked rapidly and noiselessly on the toes of his boots,
and kept to the dark side of the lane.&nbsp; They entered the
yards beyond the station building, and went to the farther end,
where several tracks were occupied by antiquated coaches that
looked like a cross between open street cars and English
third-class railway carriages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We used these rattletraps before they changed the line
to steam.&nbsp; It took six mules to haul one of &rsquo;em up
from the junction of the Mexico and Vera Cruz road; but they can
go down flying!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s down grade all the way for
nearly forty miles.&nbsp; They are rather wabbly now, but if you
get one with a good brake, it will last the trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tried several of the old cars, and finally selected one
with a brake that worked to his satisfaction.&nbsp; Together they
could just start it, and they pushed it out to the main
track.&nbsp; Brainard threw his valise aboard, and took his post,
as the railroad man directed him, at the handbrake.</p>
<p><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll open the gate for you, and set the
switch; then it&rsquo;s clear sailing.&nbsp; Go slow until you
learn the trick, then let her sail.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a bad
curve about seven miles out, and a couple of miles farther on
you&rsquo;ll find a considerable hill and some up grade.&nbsp;
You must let her slide down the hill for all she can do, and take
the grade on her own momentum.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t, you may
get stuck.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t think of anything else.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll roll down to the junction in a couple of hours, as
pretty as coasting, if that confounded <i>peon</i> hasn&rsquo;t
left the switch open at Cavallo.&nbsp; If he has, you&rsquo;ll
just have to jump for it, and foot it down through the chaparral,
if you haven&rsquo;t broken your neck.&nbsp; Needn&rsquo;t bother
to return the car,&rdquo; he chuckled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is there
anything else I can do for you, young man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got me out of a tight hole,&rdquo;
Brainard replied warmly, &ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t begin to thank
you for it.&nbsp; I hope I shall see you up North some day, and
be able to do something for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t likely we&rsquo;ll meet in the
States.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t want me up there!&rdquo; the
Southerner answered slowly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But perhaps, sometime,
you&rsquo;ll be able to help a poor fellow out of <i>his</i> hole
in the same way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That woman may strike the scent, and come hot-foot to
Vera Cruz by the first train.&nbsp; Well, <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>I&rsquo;ll
have to take my chances there before the boat sails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave her to me and Hollinger.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll give
her a tip that you have gone North.&rdquo;&nbsp; Calloway
laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;If she won&rsquo;t take it, there are other
ways of stopping her activity.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a good deal of
smallpox hereabouts, you know, and if the mayor suspected these
<i>gringos</i> had the disease, he&rsquo;d chuck &rsquo;em into
the pesthouse.&nbsp; Don Salvador does pretty much what I tell
him&mdash;and the hotel-keeper, too.&nbsp; I think we can keep
your friends quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get me twelve hours, if you can!&nbsp; And tell
Hollinger I&rsquo;m on the job again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men shook hands; Calloway pushed back the great gate;
and the car slid down the track out into the warm, black night,
groaning to itself asthmatically as it gathered impetus.</p>
<h3><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>XVI</h3>
<p>The Transatlantique line steamer <i>Toulouse</i> lay off the
breakwater of Vera Cruz, smoking fiercely, anchor up, passengers
all aboard, ready to sail for Havre.&nbsp; Her departure had been
delayed nearly eighteen hours by a fierce &ldquo;norther,&rdquo;
which had not yet exhausted its fury.&nbsp; They had been anxious
hours for Brainard, who had gone aboard the night before, in the
expectation of sailing immediately.&nbsp; Now the black smoke
pouring from the funnel indicated that the captain had decided to
proceed, and Brainard&rsquo;s spirits rose.</p>
<p>Nothing had been seen or heard of the stenographer and her
companion.&nbsp; Either they had lost the trail, or his friends
at Jalapa had succeeded in holding them there for almost two
days, and had kept them away from the telegraph, too.</p>
<p>Brainard was about to leave the deck, where he had been
anxiously watching the land, when his attention was caught by a
small launch that was rounding the end of the pier and heading
for the steamer.&nbsp; His hands tightened on the rail; he
suspected what that launch might contain.&nbsp; He <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>noted that
the steamer was moving slowly.&nbsp; Would the captain wait?</p>
<p>The <i>Toulouse</i> had swung around; her nose pointed out
into the Gulf of Mexico, and her screw revolved at quarter
speed.&nbsp; The launch approached rapidly, and signaled the
steamer to wait.&nbsp; Brainard could see the smart French
captain, on the bridge above, examining the small boat through
glasses.&nbsp; He himself could detect two figures in the bow,
waving a flag, and he smiled grimly at the comedy about to take
place at his expense.</p>
<p>The screw ceased to revolve.&nbsp; As the launch came within
hailing distance, there was an animated colloquy in French
between the officers on the bridge of the <i>Toulouse</i> and the
man in charge of the launch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some late passengers,&rdquo; remarked the third
officer, who was standing beside Brainard.&nbsp; &ldquo;A woman,
too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently neither the stenographer&mdash;for now he could
recognize the young woman&mdash;nor her companion, a stout,
middle-aged, red-cheeked American, understood the French
language.&nbsp; They kept gesticulating and pointing to Brainard,
whom they had discovered on the deck.&nbsp; The captain of the
launch translated their remarks, and threw in some explanations
of his own.&nbsp; The <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>officers from the bridge of the
<i>Toulouse</i> fired back vigorous volleys of questions.&nbsp;
It was an uproar!</p>
<p>Brainard, in spite of his predicament, burst into laughter
over the frantic endeavors of the two Americans to make
themselves understood.&nbsp; The captain tried his English, but
with poor results.&nbsp; Finally, with a gesture of disgust, he
yanked the bell rope.&nbsp; Brainard could hear the gong sound in
the engine room beneath for full speed.&nbsp; The <i>Toulouse</i>
would not wait.</p>
<p>The steamer began to gather speed, the launch to fall behind,
while the woman at the bow shrieked and pointed to
Brainard.&nbsp; The captain of the <i>Toulouse</i> merely
shrugged his shoulders and walked to the other side of his
vessel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some friends of yours?&rdquo; the third officer said to
Brainard, with a grin, as the little launch fell into their wake
and finally turned back toward the inner harbor.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
lady seemed anxious to join you&mdash;might be a wife,
<i>non</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently he knew enough English to enable him to conjecture
what the two Americans wanted.&nbsp; If, thought Brainard, the
captain had known as much English as his third officer, it might
not have gone so happily for him!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lady isn&rsquo;t exactly my wife,&rdquo; Brainard
replied, with a laugh; &ldquo;not yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; the Frenchman said, with a meaning <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;What you in the States call a
breach of the promise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; Brainard replied hastily, glad to
accept such a credible fiction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She seems sorry to let you make the journey alone,
eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The story circulated on the ship that evening, and gave
Brainard a jocular notoriety in the smoking room among the German
and French business men, who composed most of the
<i>Toulouse&rsquo;s</i> first-cabin list.&nbsp; It was forgotten,
however, before he emerged from his cabin, to which the remains
of the &ldquo;norther&rdquo; had quickly driven him.&nbsp; By
this time&mdash;it was the fourth day out&mdash;the
<i>Toulouse</i> was in the grasp of the Gulf Stream, lazily
plowing her twelve knots an hour into the North Atlantic, and the
passengers were betting their francs on the probable day of
arrival at Havre.</p>
<p>That evening, at dinner, Brainard ordered a bottle of
champagne, and murmured, as he raised the glass to his lips:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to Melody&mdash;whoever and whatever and
wherever she may be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His youthful fancy, warmed by the wine, played again with the
idea of an unknown mistress for whom he was bound across the seas
with her <a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>fortune in his grip.&nbsp; With the insistence of
youth, he had made up his mind that Melody must be a
woman&mdash;what else could she be?&nbsp; He always saw her as a
young woman, charming, beautiful, of course, and free!</p>
<p>And yet she might well be some aged relative of Krutzmacht, or
a fair friend of his youth, to whom, in the moment of decision
allowed him, he had desired to leave his fortune; or some
unrecognized wife, to whom, at the threshold of death, he thought
to do tardy justice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An old hag, perhaps!&rdquo; the young man murmured with
a grimace.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see&mdash;over
there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But his buoyant fancy refused to vision this elusive Melody as
other than young and beautiful.&nbsp; And he gave her the
attractive shape and personality of Se&ntilde;orita Marie.&nbsp;
He began to think of her as living in some obscure corner of the
great world, waiting to be dowered with the fortune that he had
bravely rescued for her.</p>
<p>When Brainard felt that his stomach and his sea legs were both
impeccable, he descended to his cabin, bolted the door, pulled
the shade carefully over the porthole, pinned newspapers above
the wooden partitions, and proceeded to make a leisurely
examination of the valise.&nbsp; It was the first safe moment
that he had had to go through the contents of the bag thoroughly;
and when <a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>the key sank into the lock, his curiosity was whetted
to a fine edge.</p>
<p>He had already made a careful count of the notes and gold left
after his devious journey to Vera Cruz.&nbsp; The sum was eight
thousand dollars and some hundreds.&nbsp; This he had entered on
a blank leaf in a little diary, under the heading &ldquo;Melody,
Cr.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the opposite page he had put down all the
sums that he remembered to have spent since leaving New York,
even to his cigarettes and the bottle of champagne which he had
drunk in honor of his unknown mistress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here goes!&rdquo; he said at last.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what Melody&rsquo;s pile is,
anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took the best part of the night to examine thoroughly what
the bag held.&nbsp; Even after he had gone over every piece,
Brainard, untrained in business matters, could but guess at the
full importance of his haul.&nbsp; There were contracts and deeds
and leases relating to a network of corporations, of which the
most important, apparently, was the Pacific Northern Railway.</p>
<p>Despairing of understanding the full value of these documents
without some clew, Brainard contented himself with making a
careful inventory of them.&nbsp; The meat of the lot, he judged,
lay in certain bundles of neatly engraved five-per-cent bonds of
the Pacific Northern, together with a <a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>number of certificates of stock in
the Shasta Company.&nbsp; In all, as he calculated, there were
eight millions of bonds and fifteen millions, par value, of
stock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Melody doesn&rsquo;t look to me to be a poor
lady,&rdquo; Brainard muttered, bundling up the bonds and stock,
and packing them carefully away at the bottom of the
valise.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are welcome to the rest, if
they&rsquo;ll let me off with these pretty things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What was more, he had come across the name of Schneider
Brothers, bankers, Berlin, on the letterhead of several
communications, indicating that they had been the dead
man&rsquo;s foreign fiscal agents.&nbsp; That would be of use to
him, he noted, as he wrote the name in his little diary.&nbsp;
Then he went on deck, lighted a long Mexican cigar, and began to
think.&nbsp; The value of his haul made him very serious.&nbsp;
Latterly his adventure had more or less the irresponsibility of a
boy&rsquo;s lark about it, but now it assumed larger
importance.&nbsp; What he had done was a serious matter in the
eyes of the law, and he must justify his proceedings, not only to
himself, but to others. . . .</p>
<p>The days of the lazy, sunny voyage slipped away.&nbsp; As the
vessel drew nearer Europe, Brainard speculated more and more
anxiously on what might be waiting for him on the dock at
Havre.&nbsp; Now that he knew how valuable his loot was, he <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>felt
certain that old Krutzmacht&rsquo;s San Francisco enemies, who
had tracked him to the dock at Vera Cruz, would hardly be idle
during the sixteen days that the <i>Toulouse</i> had taken to
cross the seas.&nbsp; There had been ample time for them to hear
from the stenographer and their other agents in Mexico, to
communicate with the French authorities, to have detectives cross
from New York by one of the express boats and meet him at
Havre.&nbsp; There would be a fine reception committee prepared
for him on the dock!</p>
<p>Cudgel his brains as he might, hour after hour, he could see
no way out of the predicament that was daily drawing
nearer.&nbsp; After the incident at Vera Cruz, he could not
approach any of the officers of the vessel and seek to enlist
their help.&nbsp; He thought of bribing the sociable third
officer to secrete the contents of his valise, but he mistrusted
his volatile temperament.&nbsp; There was a Frenchwoman who sat
next him at the table, a dark-haired little person, clever and
businesslike, who had been very agreeable to Brainard, and had
undertaken to teach him French.&nbsp; He could tell his story to
Mme Vernon, and ask her to assume charge of the troublesome
valise.&nbsp; But an instinctive caution restrained him from
taking any one into his confidence.&nbsp; He preferred to run his
chance of arrest, and to fight against extradition.&nbsp; <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>Whenever he
resigned himself to this prospect, his sporting blood rebelled,
and there rose, also, a new sentiment of loyalty to the interests
of his unknown mistress, Melody.&nbsp; He had come too far in his
venture to be beaten now!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether the old man was straight or not, whether he
really owned the bunch of bonds and stock or not, it would be a
pity not to get something out of it for Melody.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
not in the scrap,&rdquo; he said to himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, I
don&rsquo;t chuck the game yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His anxieties were quieted by another fit of seasickness on
the day before they were due to arrive at Havre.&nbsp; As she
approached the coast of Brittany, the <i>Toulouse</i> lost the
balmy weather which had prevailed since they entered the Gulf
Stream, and ran straight into a gale that was sweeping over the
boisterous Bay of Biscay.&nbsp; Brainard went to bed, to spend
altogether the most wretched twenty-four hours he had ever
experienced.</p>
<p>In his more conscious moments he gathered that the old
<i>Toulouse</i> was having as hard a time with the weather as he
was.&nbsp; Her feeble engines at last lay down on the job, and
the captain was forced to turn about and run before the
storm.&nbsp; It mattered little to Brainard, just then, whether
the ship was blown to the Azores, or went to the bottom, or
carried him into Havre, there to be <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>arrested and finally deported to the
United States for grand larceny.&nbsp; He turned in his berth,
thought of the <i>Bourgogne</i>, and closed his weary eyes.</p>
<p>Toward evening the gale blew itself out, and the battered old
<i>Toulouse</i> was headed north once more across the Bay of
Biscay.&nbsp; Sometime in the night the engines ceased to thump,
and Brainard awoke with a start.&nbsp; When he had hurried into
his clothes, and groped his way to the deck, he was astonished to
see ahead, through the gray fog of early morning, faint lights
and, farther away, the stronger illumination that came from some
city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it Havre?&rdquo; he demanded of the third officer,
whom he met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, monsieur&mdash;St. Nazaire!&rdquo; the Frenchman
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Monsieur will be disappointed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so!&rdquo; exclaimed Brainard.</p>
<p>It was, indeed, the port of Nantes.&nbsp; The captain had not
chosen to risk the voyage around the stormy coast of Brittany
with his depleted coal supply, and had taken the old
<i>Toulouse</i> to the nearest port.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where Melody scores!&rdquo; Brainard
muttered, when he realized the significance of the news.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now for a quick exit to Paris, before the telegraph gets
in its deadly work and notifies the civilized world where we
are!&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>XVII</h3>
<p>Three hours later the passengers of the <i>Toulouse</i> were
aboard a special train for Paris, and in a first-class
compartment Brainard was seated, facing his valise, and looking
out upon the pleasant landscape of the Loire valley, a contented
expression on his brown young face.</p>
<p>He had already formulated to himself the exact plot of his
movements from the moment he reached Paris.&nbsp; From the
pleasant Frenchwoman who had been his neighbor at the
ship&rsquo;s table he had learned the address of a little hotel
in the Bourse quarter, where she assured him that Americans
rarely appeared.&nbsp; It was not far from the large bank in
which he intended to deposit Melody&rsquo;s burdensome fortune
until he could make arrangements for disposing of it.</p>
<p>It did not take him long, therefore, to install himself at the
little H&ocirc;tel des Voyageurs et Br&eacute;sil, and to rid
himself of his troublesome loot.&nbsp; Then he wrote a letter to
Schneider Brothers, of Berlin, who, he had learned at the
Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais, were a well-known firm of bankers with an
agency in New York.&nbsp; He wrote the Messrs. Schneider <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>that in
obedience to the instructions of the late Mr. Herbert Krutzmacht,
of San Francisco, he wished to consult with them in regard to the
disposal of some securities that he had in his possession.&nbsp;
He would remain for the present in Paris, and he begged to
suggest that the bankers should send a responsible agent to meet
him at some place&mdash;preferably The Hague, whither he was
going the following week.</p>
<p>He had selected The Hague as a safe middle ground, after
consulting the map of Europe in his guidebook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will draw their fire,&rdquo; he thought
complacently.&nbsp; &ldquo;We shall see on which side of the game
they are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having mailed the letter, he strolled out to the boulevards to
enjoy his first whiff of Paris.&nbsp; This was the city that he
had walked in his dreams!&nbsp; He had never hoped to see it; but
now he was strolling along the Boulevard des Italiens, and there
before his eyes lay the great Place de l&rsquo;Op&eacute;ra, with
its maze of automobiles, &rsquo;buses, and pedestrians.&nbsp; And
there&mdash;Brainard stopped in the middle of the crowded
<i>place</i>, wrapped in wonder, staring at the gilded figures on
the fa&ccedil;ade of the Op&eacute;ra, until an excitable
official with a white baton poured a stream of voluble
expostulation into his ear, and he dodged from under an omnibus
<a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>just in
time to fall into the path of a motor, causing general
execration.</p>
<p>The official with the white stick finally landed him on the
curb before he became an obstruction to traffic.&nbsp; He sank
into an inviting iron chair and ordered a drink, as he saw that
that was what the Parisians used their sidewalks for.&nbsp; In
answer to his labored French, there came back in the purest
Irish:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whisky, sor?&nbsp; Black and White, sor?&nbsp; Very
good, sor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo; he murmured, radiant with
happiness.</p>
<p>When the waiter reappeared with the drink, he was gazing down
the broad avenue, entranced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does that go?&rdquo; he whispered to the waiter,
thrusting a bill into the curving palm and pointing vaguely
before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Luver, sure, sor.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be wanting a
nurse before the day is done!&rdquo; the Irishman muttered.</p>
<p>And indeed the self-contained young American began to act like
a lunatic let loose.&nbsp; Gulping down his whisky, he set off at
random, plunging again into the sea of traffic, finally escaping
to the shelter of a cab.&nbsp; The driver, after vain attempts to
extract an intelligible order from his fare, just drove on and on
through the boulevards, across <a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>great squares, up the noble avenue
to the lofty arch, and then came back to the center of the city
and stopped suggestively before a restaurant.</p>
<p>Somehow Brainard managed to get fed, and then the fatherly
cabby received him and bore him on through the gas-lighted
streets, soft and lambent and vocal, and at the end of another
hour deposited him in front of what Brainard took to be a
theater&mdash;a modest-looking building enough.&nbsp; From the
poster he saw that it was the Fran&ccedil;ais.</p>
<p>The great Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais!&nbsp; He
beamed back at cabby, who gesticulated with his whip and urged
him on.&nbsp; Cabby had begun sympathetically to comprehend his
lunatic.</p>
<p>They played <i>Cyrano</i> that night, it happened.&nbsp;
Though the fluent lines rolled too swiftly over Brainard&rsquo;s
head for his feeble comprehension of the language, he understood
the wonderful actors.&nbsp; For the first time in the
twenty-eight years of his existence, he realized what is
art&mdash;what it is to conceive and represent life with living
creatures, to clothe dull lines of print with human
passions.&nbsp; This was what he had dreamed might be when he
descended from his gallery seat in a Broadway theater&mdash;but
what never was.</p>
<p>Cabby was asleep on the box outside when Brainard emerged from
his dream.&nbsp; At the young American&rsquo;s touch, he awoke,
and, chirping to his <a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>decrepit horse, bore the stranger to
his hotel.&nbsp; At the door they exchanged vivid protestations
of regard, and a couple of pieces of gold rolled into
cabby&rsquo;s paw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He understood!&rdquo; Brainard murmured
gratefully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Demain</i>&mdash;<i>demain</i>!&rdquo; he cried; and
the <i>cocher</i> cracked his whip.</p>
<p>The next two days were the most wonderful that Brainard had
ever spent.&nbsp; He slept but a few hours each night&mdash;was
there not all the rest of life to sleep in?&nbsp; Under the fat
cabby&rsquo;s guidance he roamed day and night.&nbsp; He would
murmur from time to time some famous name which seemed to act on
cabby like a cabalistic charm,&mdash;Louvre, Panth&eacute;on, Arc
de Triomphe, Invalides, Bastille, Luxembourg, N&ocirc;tre
Dame.&nbsp; At noon and at night they drew up before some
marvelous restaurant where the most alluring viands were to be
had.&nbsp; Each evening there was a theater, carefully chosen by
cabby; and there Brainard spent enchanted hours, drinking in at
every sense the meaning of the play, savoring the charm of
intonation, of line, of gesture&mdash;the art which seemed innate
in these people.</p>
<p>For was he not, as he had said to Krutzmacht, by profession a
dramatist?</p>
<p>The third day he bethought him of the French lady of the
<i>Toulouse</i>, and gave her address to <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>his
guardian.&nbsp; With her he made an expedition to
Versailles.&nbsp; On their return from the ch&acirc;teau, they
dined at a little restaurant at Ville d&rsquo;Avray, the
Frenchwoman carefully ordering the food and the wine.</p>
<p>As the twilight fell across the old ponds and over the woods
where Corot had once wandered, Brainard murmured softly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Melody, my dear, I owe you a whole lot for
this&mdash;more than I can ever pay you, no matter how much I can
squeeze out of those Dutchmen for your bonds and
stock!&rdquo;&nbsp; And then, aloud, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to
Melody&mdash;God bless her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mel-odie!&rdquo; said the French lady daintily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is a pretty name.&nbsp; Is that the name of your
<i>fianc&eacute;e</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, madam!&nbsp; I have never seen the lady&mdash;but I
hope to, some day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Frenchwoman smiled and made no comment, puzzled by this
latest manifestation of the lunatic American.</p>
<p>After dinner they strolled through the ancient park of St.
Cloud to the river, and took a <i>bateau mouche</i> for
Paris.&nbsp; Mme. Vernon seemed to understand all the pleasant
little ways of enjoying life.&nbsp; It was a warm, starry
night.&nbsp; The French lady sat close to Brainard, and looked up
tenderly into his eyes, but though his lips were wreathed <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>in smiles,
and his eyes were bright, he did not seem to comprehend what such
opportunities were made for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even took my hand once!&rdquo; she murmured to
herself with a sigh, as she mounted the stairs to her apartment
alone.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are these Americans made of?&nbsp; To
drink to the name of an unknown, and spend their dollars like
sous.&nbsp; And always business!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For when she had suggested an excursion for the morrow, the
young man had excused himself on the plea of &ldquo;my
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always business!&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>But the lady did Brainard an injustice.&nbsp; He was thinking
little of business.&nbsp; If she had but known it, he was in
love, and dreaming&mdash;in love with life, and dreaming of the
wonderful mystery of Krutzmacht and of the still more mysterious
Melody!</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>At his hotel there was a dispatch from the Schneider Brothers,
appointing a meeting at a hotel in The Hague for the following
evening.</p>
<h3><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>XVIII</h3>
<p>When a servant had ushered Brainard into a private
<i>salon</i> of the old Bible Hotel, and discreetly closed the
door, an alert, middle-aged German with grizzled hair and
close-trimmed beard rose from a table and advanced with
outstretched hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Brainard, I presume?&rdquo; he said in fluent
English.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am Adolf Schneider.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s important enough for the old boy to come
himself!&rdquo; Brainard thought as they shook hands.</p>
<p>Herr Schneider cast a quick look at the small bag which the
servant had taken from Brainard&rsquo;s hand and placed beside
his coat and hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t brought the papers with you!&rdquo;
the banker exclaimed with unconscious disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are in a safe place,&rdquo; Brainard replied;
&ldquo;but I have a pretty complete inventory of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew from his pocket a copy of the list that he had made on
board the <i>Toulouse</i>, and also a copy of the power of
attorney that Krutzmacht <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>had signed.&nbsp; The former he
handed to the banker, who seized it with a poorly assumed air of
indifference, and ran his eye down the list.</p>
<p>Herr Schneider&rsquo;s face expanded, it seemed to Brainard,
as he neared the bottom; but without making any comment he took a
list from his pocket and compared it with Brainard&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
When he had finished, he looked at the young man with fresh
interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some more stuff&mdash;books and files of
papers, which I packed in a trunk,&rdquo; Brainard
explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I had to leave the trunk behind
me.&nbsp; It should be safe in Chicago by this time, and I can
get it, if it&rsquo;s still there, when I return to
America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were thorough!&rdquo; the banker exclaimed with a
smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;You did not leave much behind you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently Herr Schneider already knew something about the
raid upon Krutzmacht&rsquo;s safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took everything in sight,&rdquo; Brainard said
simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am to understand that you have
these&rdquo;&mdash;the banker pointed to the
inventory&mdash;&ldquo;with you in Europe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are where I can get at them easily,&rdquo;
Brainard replied guardedly.</p>
<p>For several moments the two men looked at each other across
the table.</p>
<p><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>&ldquo;What do you mean to do with it?&rdquo; the
banker asked casually at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet,&rdquo; Brainard replied
lightly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want to find out what it&rsquo;s worth,
if I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your <i>coup</i> has created much excitement in certain
quarters.&nbsp; I suppose you are aware of that,&rdquo; Herr
Adolf observed in a warning tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will find it
difficult to negotiate any securities you may have&mdash;if you
escape worse complications!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard realized that the German was speaking
diplomatically&mdash;bluffing, to use a plainer word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have merely obeyed the orders I received,&rdquo; he
observed innocently, handing the banker a copy of
Krutzmacht&rsquo;s power of attorney.&nbsp; &ldquo;Unfortunately,
as you know, Mr. Krutzmacht died suddenly, and I am left with
only the most general instructions to direct my future
movements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The banker glanced at the power of attorney, and, shrugging
his shoulders, handed it back to Brainard.&nbsp; Apparently he
preferred to regard the young stranger as merely a clever
adventurer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That can&rsquo;t be of much use to you,&rdquo; he said
coldly.</p>
<p>Brainard tipped back in his chair and eyed the banker.&nbsp;
Finally he brought the chair down on the floor with a bang, and,
leaning forward, tapped the banker pleasantly on the knee.</p>
<p><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no crook, Herr Schneider&mdash;not
really, you know!&nbsp; You can think so, if you want to, but it
won&rsquo;t make the price of the goods any cheaper in the
end.&nbsp; You might like to hear how I happened to get mixed up
in this affair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He proceeded to tell the story of his movements since that
April evening when he had found Krutzmacht in a fit on a New York
street.&nbsp; He omitted all references to the vague Melody, who
seemed irrelevant for the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An extraordinary story!&rdquo; the banker commented,
with more warmth, but still dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s all true!&rdquo; Brainard cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now I want to know a lot of things from you.&nbsp; First,
who was Krutzmacht?&nbsp; And why was the old man so dead set on
getting his property over here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The banker&rsquo;s manner relaxed into its habitual
suavity.&nbsp; This extraordinary young American, who looted
safes for a chance acquaintance, amused as well as puzzled
him.&nbsp; Evidently Brainard was not easily intimidated.&nbsp;
The banker resolved upon another method of attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, young man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you know
nothing more than you have told me about
your&mdash;employer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly a thing&mdash;except that he was mixed <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>up in some
big business deals.&nbsp; Naturally, these past weeks, I have
wondered a good deal about who he was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think you might!&rdquo; the banker agreed,
with a laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can tell you in a few words what I
know about him.&nbsp; Mr. Herbert Krutzmacht was a countryman of
mine, as you might infer from his name&mdash;a native of
Mannheim.&nbsp; He went to the States when he was a young man,
back in the fifties.&nbsp; Like so many of my countrymen, he
carried nothing to your land but his brains and his will.&nbsp;
He had many adventures out there.&nbsp; After your Civil War, he
moved to the Pacific coast, engaged in mining operations, made a
great deal of money, and lost it.&nbsp; He put it all into one
property, from which he expected to take a vast fortune,
but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Monument, Arizona?&rdquo; Brainard interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Arizona, I think.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t remember the
name of the place.&nbsp; The mine was called&mdash;let me
see&mdash;yes, the Melody mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Melody!&rdquo; Brainard exclaimed, startled.&nbsp;
&ldquo;So that was it, was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;merely a guess of mine.&nbsp; Please
proceed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the failure of his mine he had a hard <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>time, and
everything seemed against him.&nbsp; Then, a few years ago, he
got control of a company to develop water power in northern
California&mdash;the Shasta Company, it was called.&nbsp; From
this he went into land and timber business, and finally began to
build a railroad, the Pacific Northern.&nbsp; From time to time,
as he needed money for his various enterprises, he applied to us,
and we found the capital for him when he could not get it in the
States.&nbsp; It was our capital, mostly, that went into the
railroad, which was to go northward into a region controlled by
other roads.&nbsp; That started the opposition in California to
him and his schemes, and trouble quickly developed.&nbsp; Your
countrymen, Mr. Brainard, are not always scrupulous in the
weapons they use.&nbsp; These hostile parties had bought up one
of the judges in California, and they struck their blow while Mr.
Krutzmacht was in New York a month or more ago conferring with
our representative.&nbsp; It had been arranged to raise the
necessary funds to pay the interest due on the outstanding bonds,
and to complete the railroad.&nbsp; Then Mr. Krutzmacht
disappeared, the California court granted the other side their
receivership, and he was found dead in a New York
hospital!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been foul play!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>&ldquo;As I figure it out, those crooks must have been
watching him all the time in New York, and when they learned that
he had succeeded in raising this money he needed to keep his
property out of their hands, they did not wait.&nbsp;
They&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; the banker demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Made away with him&mdash;drugged him, probably, then
chucked him out of a cab into the street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite possibly that was it.&nbsp; Your people do such
peculiar things!&nbsp; Well, the crooks, as you call them, got
their receivership for the Shasta Company&mdash;the parent
company&mdash;the very day he died.&nbsp; Krutzmacht was a
fighter, a hard man to conquer, and if he had lived, I have very
little doubt that he would have succeeded in worsting his
enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now?&rdquo; Brainard asked with a smile.&nbsp; The
banker made a comical gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The receiver found very little to receive, naturally,
after your visit.&nbsp; Of course, you can understand what they
were after was not the Shasta Company, but its rich
subsidiaries.&nbsp; You had left the shell, of which the Court
has taken physical possession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old boy knew what he was about,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;There was no time to lose!&nbsp; Tell
me,&rdquo; <a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>he asked abruptly, &ldquo;do you know whether
Krutzmacht had any relatives&mdash;any heirs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have some connections at Mannheim.&nbsp;
Krutzmacht is a common enough name there.&nbsp; But I do not
think that any of them were closely related to Mr. Herbert
Krutzmacht.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean thirty-third cousins.&nbsp; Had he a
wife or children?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The banker hesitated, and then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several years ago, when I was in New York, I remember
meeting some woman with Mr. Krutzmacht at a hotel&mdash;a very
handsome woman, from one of your Southern States, I judged by her
accent.&nbsp; But,&rdquo; he added hastily, &ldquo;I have no
reason to believe that she was his wife.&nbsp; It is probable
that one might find out in San Francisco, where he lived the
latter part of his life.&nbsp; I could not say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far as you know, there is no one interested in this
deal?&rdquo; Brainard persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The heirs will announce themselves soon enough, if
there are any.&nbsp; Until then,&rdquo; Herr Schneider remarked
slyly, &ldquo;we need not go into the question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young American stared at the banker with honest,
uncomprehending eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s just what it is my business to
do!&rdquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;There was some one, I am
sure, whom the old man tried to tell me about.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was too far gone to say the whole name, but I think
he had in mind some one whom he wanted to have his money.&nbsp;
You see how it is, Herr Schneider.&nbsp; I am acting as this old
fellow&rsquo;s representative&mdash;his executor, so to
speak&mdash;to take care of his property and hand it over to some
one named Melody, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Melody?&rdquo; inquired the banker, puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;that was what I made it out to be,&rdquo;
Brainard said, blushing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that was the name of the Arizona mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might perhaps be the name of&mdash;of a person,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The banker shrugged his shoulders.&nbsp; He turned to the
inventory.&nbsp; Putting on his glasses, he re-read the paper
carefully.&nbsp; When he had finished, he glanced up, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Brainard, now for business, as your people
say.&nbsp; What do you want me to give you in exchange for these
securities and papers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What they are worth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that would be very hard to say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would they be worth to Mr. Krutzmacht, if he were
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Mr. Krutzmacht were alive, they might be worth a
great deal,&rdquo; the banker said cautiously, <a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>&ldquo;and
yet they might have no value, now that he is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seemed to think they had some value,&rdquo; Brainard
said flatly.</p>
<p>The banker fidgeted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course, naturally!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they can&rsquo;t have lost all their value within a
few weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One company is bankrupt already.&nbsp; This suit, the
irregular manner in which possession of these papers was
obtained&mdash;&rdquo; began the banker, fencing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you give, cash down?&rdquo; demanded
Brainard.</p>
<p>The banker rose from his chair and walked to the window.&nbsp;
He pulled out a fresh cigar, lighted it, laid it down, and turned
to Brainard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a great risk.&nbsp; We do not know what we can do
with the properties.&nbsp; We shall doubtless have
lawsuits.&nbsp; We may lose all.&nbsp; Let us say fifty thousand
dollars for everything&mdash;everything!&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>The banker looked keenly at Brainard, as if he thought he had
been impressive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are over eight millions of Pacific Northern
bonds, and about fifteen millions in stock&mdash;besides all the
rest,&rdquo; Brainard observed reflectively.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
won&rsquo;t do, Mr. Schneider&mdash;guess again!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>&ldquo;Stocks and bonds are worth what you can get for
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll wait, and see if I can get more for
these,&rdquo; Brainard suggested smilingly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no hurry about the matter.&nbsp; I came to
you first,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;because I supposed you would
have the old man&rsquo;s account checked up, and know just what
was coming to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The banker smiled at the young man&rsquo;s simplicity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Business is not done that way.&nbsp; It is a question
to whom the property belongs,&rdquo; he added meaningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see!&nbsp; Well, it belongs to me at
present&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us say a hundred thousand&mdash;in cash, paid to
you personally,&rdquo; the banker interrupted hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think you are bidding for stolen goods, eh, and can
get them cheap?&rdquo; Brainard suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four hundred thousand marks is much money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A whole lot of money&mdash;no question about
that!&rdquo; the young American remarked with a quizzical smile,
thinking that ten dollars was more ready money than he had had,
of his own, for many months.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t
enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you not ready for dinner?&rdquo; the banker
suggested genially.&nbsp; &ldquo;We can have our dinner <a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>here and
talk matters over quietly.&nbsp; I will explain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They dined at great leisure, while the banker gave Brainard
his first lessons in corporation finance, with apt illustrations
from the history of Krutzmacht&rsquo;s enterprises.&nbsp; He
explained how an individual or a corporation might be put into
bankruptcy and yet be intrinsically very rich,&mdash;the spoil
always going to the stronger in the struggle.&nbsp; He had
ordered a magnum of champagne, and pressed the wine upon the
young man with hospitable persistence; but Brainard felt that if
he ever wanted to keep his head clear, this was the time, and he
drank little.&nbsp; He suspected the banker&rsquo;s
geniality.</p>
<p>From finance the banker drifted to the topic of Krutzmacht
himself.&nbsp; He told many stories of the old man, which showed
his daring and his ability to take what he could get wherever he
found it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was always talking about that mine&mdash;the one in
Arizona.&nbsp; He expected to make a very big fortune from it
some day.&nbsp; It was to get money with which to develop his
mine, I believe, that he went into all the other things,&rdquo;
Herr Schneider explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Melody mine!&rdquo; the young man murmured to
himself.</p>
<p><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>&ldquo;That was it!&nbsp; He sank one fortune in it,
but he would never let go&mdash;that was his way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they had reached their coffee, the banker turned suddenly
upon Brainard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you made up your mind to take my offer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your people here have a good deal of money tied up in
this business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good deal more than I wish we had,&rdquo; the banker
replied frankly.&nbsp; &ldquo;So we must send more down the well
to bring back what&rsquo;s there already.&nbsp; We shall have a
fight on our hands, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand business,&rdquo; the young man
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;The chances are that
Mel&mdash;Krutzmacht&rsquo;s heirs don&rsquo;t, either.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s why he told me to come over here to dispose of his
stuff.&nbsp; The best I can do is to take cash and
quit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; the banker beamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Brainard drawled, &ldquo;we
don&rsquo;t sell Krutzmacht&rsquo;s private things&mdash;the
mine, I mean&mdash;the Melody mine.&rdquo;&nbsp; The banker waved
his hand indifferently.&nbsp; &ldquo;And for the rest you can
give us&rdquo;&mdash;the banker held his cigar poised in the
air&mdash;&ldquo;two millions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The banker leaped to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You swindler!&rdquo; he shouted angrily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You have the impudence&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>&ldquo;Careful!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s not a pretty name,
Herr Schneider,&rdquo; Brainard replied coldly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Perhaps I am not the only crook in this business.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t get excited.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t have to take my
offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The banker slowly subsided into his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall appeal to the courts!&rdquo; he snarled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What courts?&nbsp; I thought you might try to bluff,
and so I suggested having our talk in some neutral
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are pretty shrewd, my young man.&nbsp; You take all
these precautions for the sake of Mr. Krutzmacht&rsquo;s heirs, I
suppose,&rdquo; he sneered unpleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Careful now!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mind one bit going to
a Dutch jail for slugging you; but what good would that do either
of us?&nbsp; The stuff isn&rsquo;t here, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this Brainard rose to his feet and took his coat and
bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; the banker asked in some
alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll take a look about the place, I guess,
and then go back to Paris.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe you and I
can do business to advantage in your present mood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your plunder won&rsquo;t do <i>you</i> any good,&rdquo;
the banker observed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t raise a penny
on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about that.&nbsp; There are
others who might be willing to pay me something for the
paper.&nbsp; I have a pretty good idea that their agents are
hunting for my address at the present moment.&nbsp; Suppose I let
them find me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call it a million marks!&rdquo; the banker snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said two million dollars, and I&rsquo;ll keep the
bonds, too.&nbsp; You said they were no good, as I
understand.&nbsp; They might as well stay with me, in that
case.&nbsp; They look pretty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The banker gave him an evil look.&nbsp; Brainard, unconcerned,
rang for a waiter, and when the man appeared he ordered his bill
and a cab.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When can you deliver the papers&mdash;those that you
have with you in Europe?&rdquo; the banker asked briskly, when
the servant had departed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whenever you are ready with the cash&mdash;two million
dollars, not marks&mdash;Herr Schneider!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One doesn&rsquo;t carry two million dollars in
one&rsquo;s trousers pockets, over here,&rdquo; the banker
sneered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give you one week to deliver the cash in
Paris,&rdquo; Brainard replied carelessly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just
seven days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your cab is waiting, sir,&rdquo; the waiter
announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right!&nbsp; You will have to excuse me, Herr
Schneider.&nbsp; I want to take a look about the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thus they parted without shaking hands.</p>
<p><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>&ldquo;Tell the driver,&rdquo; Brainard said to the
waiter, &ldquo;to show me everything worth seeing in your
town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he settled himself into the cab for his sightseeing, he
mused:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if I got enough!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no
telling what the stuff is really worth.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d have
given it to him for a million, all of it, if he hadn&rsquo;t
taken me for a common sneak thief.&nbsp; Well, I guess I touched
his limit.&nbsp; If he lays down on my proposition, I&rsquo;ll
have to look up the other crowd, and I suspect there isn&rsquo;t
much to choose between them so far as their methods are
concerned.&nbsp; But I bet old Schnei will turn up in Paris
before the week is out with a bag of dollars.&nbsp; And there are
the bonds&mdash;they may be worth something, after all, to
Melody!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He interrupted his meditation to squint an eye at a palace
toward which the <i>cocher</i> was furiously waving his whip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, <i>cocher</i>,&mdash;you can drive
on,&rdquo; he replied, having taken in the monument
sufficiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;he concluded his
meditation aloud&mdash;&ldquo;two millions, cash, is a pretty
good bunch of money for any girl.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe she
could have done any better herself.&nbsp; And there are the eight
millions of bonds.&nbsp; Now where in thunder <i>is</i>
Melody?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>&ldquo;<i>Was</i>?&rdquo; the coachman demanded.</p>
<p>Brainard waved him on, and continued his thoughts without
speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is the mine, too&mdash;the Melody mine.&nbsp;
Queer name for a mine, and a queer name for a woman, too, now you
think of it!&nbsp; Is there any Melody girl&mdash;woman, anyway,
anywhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mere doubt of the existence of such a personage dampened
his good spirits.&nbsp; If Melody was a fiction of his youthful
imagination, he was loath to part with her; for she had become
the possible reality that held his dream together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he concluded aloud.&nbsp; &ldquo;No man
would have made all that effort, when he was dying, to speak the
name of a mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this sage reflection he dismissed from his thoughts the
teasing puzzle of Krutzmacht and his heirs, and devoted his
entire attention to the monuments of The Hague.</p>
<h3><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>XIX</h3>
<p>Five days later Brainard stood chatting with Herr Adolf
Schneider and Herr Nathan Schneider on the broad granite steps of
the Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais in Paris.&nbsp; The transfer of all
Krutzmacht&rsquo;s papers, except the packages of bonds, had just
been completed within the bank, and receipts for them had been
given to the young American, together with drafts on New York for
two millions of dollars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I inquire what you intend to do now?&rdquo; Herr
Nathan asked, simple curiosity on his broad face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to put in one week more here, then pull
out for San Francisco, and try to hunt up my principal,&rdquo;
Brainard replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not afraid to return to the States?&rdquo; Herr
Adolf inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I be?&nbsp; Our people know when they are
licked.&nbsp; Those crooks won&rsquo;t worry me any longer.&nbsp;
More likely they&rsquo;ll be after you now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard laughed pleasantly.</p>
<p><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; Herr Nathan observed
complacently, &ldquo;we can take care of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so!&nbsp; I want to see those bonds make good
some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in a hurry to sell your bonds, young
man.&nbsp; That is my best advice,&rdquo; the banker said
gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell Mel&mdash;my principal what you
say,&rdquo; Brainard laughed back.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now good day to
you, gentlemen, and good hunting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herr Adolf shook the young man&rsquo;s hand cordially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you ever want a business&mdash;after you have
discovered this mysterious heir to Mr. Krutzmacht&mdash;why, come
over here to me, and I will make a financier of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Brainard sauntered slowly down the crowded boulevard.&nbsp; He
had before him seven more days of Paris&mdash;seven beautiful
June days.&nbsp; For he had resolved to give himself one week of
pure vacation in Paris as payment for services performed for his
unknown principal.&nbsp; Thus seriously did he hold himself to
his mission.</p>
<p>At the end of the week he would take the first fast steamer
for New York, and begin the hunt for an heir for the money he had
obtained from <a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>old Krutzmacht&rsquo;s property&mdash;for that shadowy
Melody whose name so persistently haunted his imagination.&nbsp;
But now how best could he spend these last precious hours of
freedom and delight which he had well earned?</p>
<p>The young American with two million dollars in his pockets
paused beside the curb and watched the brilliant stream of Paris
life flow past him for many minutes.&nbsp; Then he beckoned to a
cab, and drove to a steamship office, where he engaged passage
for that day week from Cherbourg.&nbsp; Next he went to a tailor,
and ordered clothes to replace his Chicago ready-made suit, which
no longer satisfied his aspirations in the way of personal
appearance.&nbsp; He did not mean to go shabby any longer, no
matter what fate might be in store for him at the close of his
present adventure.</p>
<p>These necessary duties performed, he betook himself to a
famous restaurant near the Madeleine, where he ordered an
excellent breakfast.&nbsp; While he ate, he laid his plans.</p>
<p>Brainard had made most of his journey through life without
congenial companions, but now he felt a desire for
companionship.&nbsp; It was another of those hitherto unsuspected
capacities that had been stimulated by his recent
experiences.&nbsp; He bethought himself of the only human being
he knew in all Paris&mdash;the amiable Mme. Vernon, <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>his friend
of the <i>Toulouse</i>; so after his breakfast he proceeded to
the Frenchwoman&rsquo;s hotel.&nbsp; Mme. Vernon welcomed him
cordially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you had returned to America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have another week,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;and I
want you to show me how to spend it.&nbsp; Think of everything
that a man twenty-eight years old, who has never had a
day&rsquo;s real vacation in his life, would like to see and do
in Paris, and we&rsquo;ll do it all together.&nbsp; That is, if
you can give me the time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The good-natured Frenchwoman, who had returned to her native
country after a long absence in &ldquo;barbarian lands,&rdquo;
did not seem greatly occupied, and was not averse to spending a
few days with this <i>na&iuml;f</i> American.&nbsp; She smiled
upon Brainard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a serious matter,&rdquo; she said after
meditation, wrinkling her placid brow.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you must
see all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In one week!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Allons</i>&mdash;let us start!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There began seven days of wonder and delight&mdash;enough to
pay with good measure for all the sordid years of struggle that
the young man had endured; enough to last him, if need be, for a
lifetime of dull toil.&nbsp; The amiable Frenchwoman entered into
the spirit of her task with enthusiasm <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>and a high
intelligence, and Brainard paid the way with unquestioning
liberality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my commission on two millions,&rdquo; he
said to himself, entering the items scrupulously in his little
account book.</p>
<p>From gallery and church and restaurant to theater and opera
and caf&eacute; they trailed through the sunny days and the soft
nights.&nbsp; They haunted the theaters especially, for the young
American&mdash;would-be dramatist&mdash;felt with sure instinct
that here he had discovered the pure gold of his art after the
sounding brass of Broadway.&nbsp; They went to the little
theaters hidden away in obscure corners, to the theaters of the
people, as well as to the stately stages of the Fran&ccedil;ais
and the Od&eacute;on and to the popular boulevard playhouses.</p>
<p>Brainard was like a dry sponge that soaks and soaks but never
satisfies its thirst, so Mme. Vernon declared.&nbsp; With her
help, the rapid dialogue of the theater became easily
comprehensible.&nbsp; For the young man&rsquo;s ears seemed
attuned, his whole intelligence quickened.&nbsp; He was like one
arriving, after a long journey, at the promised land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are an artist,&rdquo; the Frenchwoman flattered,
&ldquo;and should stay here with us in the land of
artists!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard merely smiled, murmuring:</p>
<p><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>&ldquo;We, too, are artists over there, in our
way&mdash;artists of life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last day came.&nbsp; At midnight the two companions
emerged upon the busy Place du Th&eacute;&acirc;tre
Fran&ccedil;ais, beside the plashing fountain.&nbsp; It had been
&ldquo;Ph&egrave;dre,&rdquo; and the Frenchwoman had yawned
through the stately lines of sublime passion.&nbsp; She would
have preferred the farce at the Palais Royal, or to prolong their
last intimate dinner at Lavenue&rsquo;s, which she loved so
well.&nbsp; But the young American had sat enthralled, and now he
walked as in a dream, with head erect.</p>
<p>In a few hours more this dream in which he had lived, this
inspired world of beauty and art, would have vanished from his
sight, never again, perhaps, to dazzle his eyes.&nbsp; Some
careless god had taken him from his dingy corner and had shown
him what a wonderful place this world can be.&nbsp; Now, after a
week spent in the city of his desires, he must return to his own
little hole, and let the clouds of reality fall between him and
his vision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why, oh, why,&rdquo; he murmured aloud,
&ldquo;can&rsquo;t we have something like that?&nbsp; Why
isn&rsquo;t there a place in all America where poor devils like
myself could drop in for a few hours of paradise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor poet!&rdquo; the Frenchwoman exclaimed, <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>guiding his
footsteps gently toward a lighted caf&eacute;.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
you like it so much, why dost thou leave thy paradise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it is so ordered,&rdquo; he replied simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as he did not answer, she suggested with a slight
smile:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By that one of whom you spoke&mdash;that
M&eacute;lodie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Melody!&rdquo; he affirmed gravely.</p>
<p>For to-night, on the eve of his departure for America, that
elusive mistress seemed especially real and compelling, no mere
figment of his heated brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, indeed,&rdquo; said the Frenchwoman, with a touch
of pique, &ldquo;you must be in love with your
M&eacute;lodie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young American laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With two millions of ready money lying close to his heart in
the drafts of the Schneider Brothers, it never entered the young
man&rsquo;s mind that he might prolong his vacation
indefinitely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay with us another eight days,&rdquo; urged his
companion, laying a caressing hand upon his arm.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Your M&eacute;lodie will wait for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>Brainard laughed, and for reply paid the waiter and
rose from the table where they sat.&nbsp; They walked out into
the soft night, and passed through the Tuileries Gardens, across
the great square beyond, with its silent monuments and gleaming
lights.&nbsp; When they reached Mme. Vernon&rsquo;s apartment,
the Frenchwoman urged him to enter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the last time,&rdquo; she said sentimentally.</p>
<p>Brainard held out a friendly hand; but she would not let him
go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not thanked you enough for this!&rdquo;&nbsp;
She pointed coquettishly to a lovely pendant which she had
admired in a window of the Rue de la Paix, and which Brainard had
bought for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing&mdash;just to remember me
by!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not need it for that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and good-by&mdash;it
has been a great week!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that was all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good night and good-by&mdash;it has been a great
week!&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; The Frenchwoman mimicked the young
man&rsquo;s words to herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Ciel</i>, what
manner of man can he be?&nbsp; Or have I grown so
old?&rdquo;&nbsp; And she answered herself with a sigh:
&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s only a poet, and he is in love
with&mdash;an idea!&nbsp; M&eacute;lodie!&nbsp; Foolish
poet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So that was the final judgment of Mme. Vernon.</p>
<p><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>But
out in the gentle June night, under the dark Paris sky, the poet
was sauntering beneath the dusky shadow of the Louvre, the music
of the lines he had heard that evening floating through his
brain.&nbsp; He drifted on past the empty courts of the old
palace, toward the river, exalted by all that he had seen and
felt during these last seven wonderful days.&nbsp; The spinning
moments of his brief dream were too precious to waste in
sleep.&nbsp; As he went, he talked aloud to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to have something like it over there.&nbsp; It
<i>could</i> be done, too!&nbsp; Melody should do it for us, with
a portion of all this loot that I am bringing back to her.&nbsp;
She should give something to America to justify her
name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Mme. Vernon had heard these muttered words, she would
doubtless have qualified her judgment of the young American by
adding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a crazy poet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed there was something scarcely rational in the young
American&rsquo;s enthusiasm, the glowing intoxication of spirit
in which he enveloped Paris.&nbsp; That too had been preparing
for him through all the vicissitudes of the past weeks,&mdash;by
the sudden resolves to commit himself to the sick man&rsquo;s
purpose, the growth of will as he met each fresh complication,
the physical and moral regeneration of the long trail into
Mexico, above <a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>all by the sense of triumph gained in his encounter
with the Berlin banker.&nbsp; The crust of his starved nature had
broken, and at the magic touch of Paris there appeared the better
spirit of the man,&mdash;fearless, enthusiastic,
worshiping,&mdash;the spirit of the artist, as Mme. Vernon had
said.&nbsp; Even in his quixotic renunciation, his determination
to turn away from the happiness he had found, there was a glowing
conviction that this was not the end.&nbsp; The spirit would
survive.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas, indeed, but the start, the
preparation for another adventure, larger, more thrilling, that
loomed before him, across the ocean.&nbsp; Paris also was but
revelation and preparation; more was to come! . . .</p>
<p>The graceful lines of the Palace of the Louvre rose
mysteriously into the night, and recalled to Brainard the pages
of old Dumas, from whom he had learned to know France.&nbsp; Home
of the past, of a great race, home of beauty and art and romance,
it called to him, young barbarian that he was, cast by chance
upon its shores!</p>
<p>Beneath the stone parapet on which he was leaning, a laden
barge passed stealthily over the black surface of the
river.&nbsp; He followed it up the quays, crossing the Pont Neuf,
over which loomed the shadowy figure of the king on horseback, on
toward Notre Dame.&nbsp; All was still <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>and silent
about the old cathedral as he paced under the shadows of the
springing buttresses.&nbsp; At last, while he lingered on the
point of the island, out of the east came a rosy light that
touched the great gray towers of the cathedral.&nbsp; It was the
misty dawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think,&rdquo; he murmured prayerfully, &ldquo;that I
might have died without knowing all this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old stone buildings along the winding river gradually
emerged from the gray mist of the dawn and hung as if suspended,
floating before his eyes.&nbsp; The thin branches of a tall
poplar waved lightly above his head, dropping to him a yellow
leaf.&nbsp; A <i>gendarme</i> who was patrolling the quay looked
interrogatively into the face of the young American, as if he
were suspicious of his proximity to the river at that hour of the
morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Beau temps</i>,&rdquo; he observed amicably to the
loiterer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; Brainard asked, coming a long
way down to earth.</p>
<p>The officer repeated his innocent remark about the
weather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the <i>temps</i> is all right,&rdquo; the young
man agreed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evidently another of those foolish Americans, star-gazing in
the early dawn!&nbsp; The officer lingered near, cocking his eye
on the stranger; but <a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>Brainard had started for his hotel,
talking to himself as he walked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a whole lot, Melody, I can never pay you
for, even with two millions and a bunch of five-per-cent
bonds!&nbsp; Where are you, Melody, in all this wide
world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly he stopped, and stood very still.&nbsp; Then,
slapping his thigh, he shouted into the dawn:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Monument!&nbsp; Monument, Arizona!&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s it!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what the old boy was trying
to say at the very end, when he was too far gone to make himself
clearly understood.&nbsp; He was trying to give me the address,
of course!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>gendarme</i>, thinking there must be something wrong
with a young man who acted in this fashion, followed Brainard to
his hotel, whither, now that he had solved his puzzle, he went at
a brisk pace.</p>
<h3><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>XX</h3>
<p>To get to that pin-prick on the map called Monument, Arizona,
you drop off the railroad at Defiance, which is somewhere east of
the water tank named Phantom, and then follow an old post road
across the lofty plateau in the direction of the mountains to the
southwest.&nbsp; After something more than twenty miles, the
trail strikes a deeply sunk river bed that winds like a gigantic
serpent over the desert toward the declining sun.&nbsp; In one of
the coils of this dead river serpent lies what is left of the
mining camp of Monument.</p>
<p>From the dusty trail over the alkali plain Brainard emerged
one blazing July afternoon, saddle-sore after his unaccustomed
exercise, and red-faced from the pitiless glare of the Arizona
sun.&nbsp; As he climbed the rocky path on the farther side of
the river bed, the sun was sinking in a gorgeous sky behind the
wooden shacks of Monument.</p>
<p>The place had the desolate air of a mining camp that had been
smothered before its boom had really come.&nbsp; The stack of a
large smelter rose from a group of corrugated iron buildings at
the further end.&nbsp; Beyond, on the summit <a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>of a
curious detached mound, set quite apart from all other features
of the landscape, there was a considerable mansion with tall
pillars along its southern front.&nbsp; This, Brainard surmised,
must have been the residence of the owner or the manager of the
mine, and his present goal.</p>
<p>Apparently Monument had not enough life left to bestir itself,
even on the arrival of a stranger.&nbsp; Brainard slid from his
horse unobserved in front of the Waldorf Hotel, which was
apparently the most pretentious hostelry in the town.&nbsp;
Inside the Waldorf, a Chinaman was serving a customer with a meal
of fried steak and liver-colored pie.&nbsp; The only other person
in the establishment was a fat Irishwoman dozing in one corner of
the large bar-room, to which the Chinaman referred the stranger,
with a silent nod.&nbsp; The landlady&mdash;for such he took her
to be&mdash;looked at Brainard stupidly, and to his request for a
room merely dropped her head on her ample breast and resumed her
nap.</p>
<p>Brainard turned back to the street, and there the only human
being in sight was an old man sitting in front of a tiny cottage,
which seemed more decent in appearance than the other residences
of Monument.&nbsp; Brainard hailed him, and inquired if there was
another hotel in Monument in which he might take refuge.</p>
<p><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s hotels enough,&rdquo; the old
citizen replied with placid irony, &ldquo;but they ain&rsquo;t
doing business these days.&nbsp; I reckon you&rsquo;ll have to
put up with the Waldorf, stranger&mdash;it ain&rsquo;t so
worse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In reply to Brainard&rsquo;s complaint that the landlady of
the Waldorf would not take notice of his arrival, the old man
remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect Katie&rsquo;s just getting over her
yesterday&rsquo;s booze.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll come around after
sundown.&nbsp; Come over and sit awhile.&nbsp; There ain&rsquo;t
any use of worryin&rsquo; yourself in this here
country!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waved an arm slowly over the empty landscape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fact&mdash;Monument doesn&rsquo;t seem
greatly rushed with business,&rdquo; Brainard observed, taking
the proffered seat beside the old man.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
the matter with the place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matter is that nothing has been doing in this here
camp for &rsquo;most ten years,&rdquo; the miner replied,
pointing to the smokeless smelter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine gave out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine&rsquo;s all right&mdash;they never really got into
it.&nbsp; The money gave out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man explained, in his placid drawl, how Monument once
had great hopes.&nbsp; Then there had been a dozen Waldorfs in
full swing.&nbsp; <a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>The smelter had been built, and shafts sunk in the
red-brown hills behind the town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Melody Mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they called it, and it&rsquo;s as
good a mine as there ever was in Arizony&mdash;better ore than
the El Verde ever had&mdash;more money in it than three El Verdes
rolled into one, I say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man spat contemptuously at a venturesome lizard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold!&nbsp; Hell, no&mdash;copper!&nbsp; High-grade
ore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them panic times came along, and the fellow that owned
the Melody went broke.&nbsp; He went back to Frisco.&nbsp; I
always expected him to ride into camp some day, when the panic
was over, hitch down there at the Waldorf, and sing out,
&lsquo;Howdy, Steve!&rsquo; and things would begin to hum once
more.&nbsp; But he never come back.&nbsp; Guess it&rsquo;s likely
he ain&rsquo;t made good out in California.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;s dead now,&rdquo; Brainard
suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps&mdash;but some other feller will
work the mine, one of these days.&nbsp; Copper&rsquo;s booming
all over the world, you understand.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m waiting for
that day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man spat meditatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that large house on the hill?&rdquo; <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>Brainard
asked, pointing to the lonely mansion beyond the town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the old man
lived&mdash;Krutzmacht&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He used to live there with his folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had a family, then?&rdquo; Brainard inquired
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some said she warn&rsquo;t really his
wife&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t be, because she had a husband where she
came from, back East.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I never
asked him.&nbsp; Folks always talk, you understand.&nbsp; Well,
she&rsquo;s dead now.&nbsp; The old man left her here when he
went away.&nbsp; She stayed on with the girl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With what girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her darter, stranger&mdash;not his, I guess.&nbsp; She
was a scraggly little black-haired thing, more like a
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard smiled as his young man&rsquo;s dream of a beautiful
heroine, with aristocratic manners and gracious character,
crumbled at the miner&rsquo;s touch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She used to ride all over the place on her
pony&mdash;she was a wild sort.&nbsp; Sometime after her mother
died, she disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did she go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man shook his head slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody could tell.&nbsp; One night, a month or more
ago, she just rode off on the trail.&nbsp; I seed her going down
there at a run on her pony, and <a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>she never came back.&nbsp;
P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps she was going to look for Krutzmacht.&nbsp;
They caught the pony over by Phantom, but nothing has been heard
of her since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Melody&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that was her name, stranger!&rdquo; the old miner
said with a look of surprise.&nbsp; &ldquo;Melody White!&nbsp;
How did you come to know it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must have guessed it,&rdquo; Brainard replied with a
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mine was named after her, or she after the mine; I
don&rsquo;t know which.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard stared out into the grim Arizona landscape, before
which rose the deserted mansion.&nbsp; There was a Melody!&nbsp;
He had never really doubted her existence, but this assurance of
his conviction pleased him, even though she might not be all that
his ardent fancy had imagined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now the house is empty, same as the mine, and I
dunno what will become of it all.&nbsp; Sold for taxes, I expect,
if they can git any one to buy it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They strolled up the road in the direction of the house upon
the hill.&nbsp; The austere dusk of the desert was settling over
the dreary habitations of Monument.&nbsp; Far away along the
horizon purple mountains lifted their heads in grandeur.</p>
<p>The house was so placed that it gave a large <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>view of the
horizon from the mountains to the distant rim of the desert and
again to mountains.&nbsp; Close beneath, in wide folds, the river
bed wound its serpent course westward into the dusk.&nbsp; Before
the broad southern veranda there were signs of old flower beds,
which had once been cherished with precious water brought in iron
pipes from the river below.&nbsp; The great white pillars had
peeled their one coat of paint, and underfoot the sun-dried
boards rattled.</p>
<p>The scene was large and grand, but inhumanly empty&mdash;as
empty as the great house itself.&nbsp; No wonder that the young
girl, her mother dead, had fled from this parched desert and
these bony mountains in search of the world of men and women, in
search of life!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kind of lonesome here?&rdquo; the miner observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you get used of it, same as death. . . .&nbsp; She
and her mother stayed here by themselves after the old man went,
and I guess the girl had enough of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old was she, do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old miner wrinkled his brows thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must have been nigh on sixteen,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;She warn&rsquo;t quite ten when Krutzmacht
left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This girl of &ldquo;nigh on sixteen&rdquo; had gone forth
alone in search of the stepfather, who for long <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>years had
left her and her mother neglected here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to see the house?&nbsp; Krutzmacht
fixed it up real elegant&mdash;carpets and mahogany stuff.&nbsp;
Nothing like it in this country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man pressed against the warped door, which yielded
after a slight resistance.&nbsp; An odor of warm, musty air from
the empty dwelling filled the lofty hall, which was quite
bare.&nbsp; The miner opened a door leading to a western
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They lived mostly in here,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>On the floor was a thick Oriental rug, and there were several
pieces of handsome furniture, especially a massive, old-fashioned
mahogany writing desk and a large divan.&nbsp; On the divan lay a
quirt and a woman&rsquo;s cloak, as if they had been thrown there
carelessly the day before.</p>
<p>The dust of the desert had already settled on the rug, the
desk, the table, and the chairs.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the room
presented a singularly living look, such as only the life of
people with certain habits and education can impress upon an
abiding place.&nbsp; Brainard felt as if he had entered a
drawing-room whose mistress had left it in the care of neglectful
servants.</p>
<p>Beside the window a small piano stood open, with a piece of
music on the rack.&nbsp; Some dead stalks of flowers drooped from
a vase, and on the <a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>hearth lay a charred log.&nbsp; Among the spools and
pieces of cloth on a worktable was a drawing board, to which was
fastened a water-color sketch.&nbsp; A brush, carelessly dropped,
had stained one corner of the sketch with a blotch of red.&nbsp;
Brainard looked at the water color with some curiosity.&nbsp; It
was a young girl&rsquo;s attempt to seize the barbaric splendor
of the arid plain outside of the window, fringed with ranges of
savage mountains, lighted by the fire of the setting sun.</p>
<p>The two men went up the broad staircase with its white-painted
handrail.&nbsp; Only one of the bedrooms had been recently
occupied&mdash;the one in the southwestern corner, facing the
winding river.&nbsp; There a dresser drawer was pulled out, as if
it had been rifled by hasty hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems as if they were really coming back agin!&rdquo;
the old miner remarked, feeling the personal touch of
occupancy.&nbsp; &ldquo;They allus kep&rsquo; to
themselves.&nbsp; You see, they didn&rsquo;t really
belong,&rdquo; he added, as if in explanation.</p>
<p>Brainard went back into the living room once more, and
examined the water-color sketch.&nbsp; It seemed to him that this
rough sketch was like a sign left for him.&nbsp; It breathed the
passion and the longing of the girl hidden away in this lonely
corner of the earth.&nbsp; He detached it gently from the board,
and put it into his pocket.&nbsp; Then, with <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>another
glance around the deserted room, he followed his guide out upon
the veranda.</p>
<p>While the old man busied himself carefully shutting up the
place, Brainard leaned against one of the white pillars and
stared into the gray evening that had stolen over the
plain.&nbsp; She had gone&mdash;the mistress whom he had tried to
serve so faithfully.&nbsp; She had disappeared into that vast,
gray outer world, that the twilight was gradually covering.</p>
<p>All the way across the ocean and the land, and especially on
the blazing trail over the alkali plain from Defiance, he had
pictured to himself the woman he hoped to find at the end of his
journey.&nbsp; He had imagined his interview with her, her
emotions of surprise and delight, when he accounted for the
fortune he was bringing her.&nbsp; At first she had been but a
name, then an idea, and this idea had gradually assumed, in his
imagination, the vivid sense of personality.&nbsp; But somehow,
in all his speculation, he had never contemplated this!&nbsp; She
lived, but she had just flitted forth&mdash;whither?</p>
<p>Suddenly it came over him that there was no clear next
step.&nbsp; For the first time since he had obeyed
Krutzmacht&rsquo;s will and taken the train westward for San
Francisco, his spirit was dampened, and in the gray evening a
weight of <a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>depression fell upon him.&nbsp; For the moment he had
no will, no plan.&nbsp; That which had held all his acts together
and made them reasonable to himself had vanished.</p>
<p>Yet the girl had left behind her an impression&mdash;a sense
of being some one, a person&mdash;which he had never had
completely before.&nbsp; Somewhere in the universe there really
was a young creature with the strange name of Melody White, to
whom belonged sundry important properties now in his
possession.&nbsp; It was clearly his business to find her if he
could! . . .</p>
<p>The old miner came stamping over the loose boards of the
veranda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The place will sure drop to pieces, like all the
rest,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;if something ain&rsquo;t done to
it mighty quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you suppose she went?&rdquo; the young man
asked abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl?&nbsp; Goodness only knows.&nbsp;
P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps she went to her mother&rsquo;s folks, or
p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps out to the coast after him&mdash;who can
tell?&nbsp; &rsquo;Twould be like hunting for a young rabbit out
there!&rdquo;&nbsp; He nodded toward the gray plain.</p>
<p>By the time that Brainard reached the Waldorf, the landlady
had roused herself, and she undertook to provide the traveler
with food and room.&nbsp; After disposing of John
Chinaman&rsquo;s fried steak and <a name="page198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>liver-colored pie, he went forth
again into Monument, seeking further information about the former
occupants of the mansion beyond the town.&nbsp; But nothing was
known of the two women except the vague rumor that the mother had
come originally from &ldquo;Louisiany way.&rdquo;&nbsp; She had
held herself apart from the little community, and most of the
present inhabitants of the place, it seemed, were derelicts who
had gathered there after the closing of the mine.&nbsp; All the
vital population had taken the trail back to the railroad shortly
after Krutzmacht&rsquo;s disappearance from the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith, I knew the gurl,&rdquo; admitted Kate, of the
Waldorf.&nbsp; &ldquo;A queer wan she was, too, ridin&rsquo;
around by night and singin&rsquo; loud up there in the big,
lonely house.&nbsp; When you heard her singin&rsquo; in the dark,
it would frighten the heart in you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But more positive information the landlady did not
possess.&nbsp; When Brainard went to his hot room for the night,
he felt &ldquo;lonesome,&rdquo; as the miner had said&mdash;as if
some one had missed an appointment with him here in the Arizona
desert.</p>
<p>The more he thought about the description the old miner had
given him, the date of her final departure, the more he became
convinced that he had seen this elusive Melody that night at
Phantom when he had dropped from the Santa F&eacute; train and
practically thrown himself upon the girl&rsquo;s <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>good nature
to guide him into safety.&nbsp; He was so preoccupied with his
own danger at the time, and the loss of his precious bag, that he
had not given much thought to the girl, had not even remembered
the talk about Krutzmacht&rsquo;s mining venture in Arizona until
later.&nbsp; So he had passed her in the dark almost at the start
of his adventure&mdash;the one whom now he was seeking in a
circle!</p>
<p>Even then, in all probability, she had planned her
flight,&mdash;he remembered how evasive she had been in reply to
his blunt questions,&mdash;and she had left not long afterwards,
within a few days, as far as he could make out.&nbsp; Yes, that
must be Melody White,&mdash;the girl &ldquo;nigh on
sixteen,&rdquo; the shy little girl with the appealing Southern
accent, who had seemed to him so lonely sitting her yellow pony
among the cactus as the night fell on the desert.&nbsp; His
imagination fastened strongly on this belief, for it gave him
fresh courage and purpose.&nbsp; If she were a being of flesh and
blood four weeks before, she must be somewhere now.&nbsp; It was
his business to find her.&nbsp; Probably she had gone first to
San Francisco in search of Krutzmacht; but when she had learned
of his death, where had she gone?&nbsp; At any rate California
was the place from which to start the long trail.</p>
<p>And a long trail, indeed, it might prove&mdash;the search for
a wild young girl on her first journey into the wide world.</p>
<h3><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>XXI</h3>
<p>In the morning, when he descended to the bar-room of the
Waldorf in search of nourishment, the old miner greeted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; he said suggestively, &ldquo;maybe
you&rsquo;d like to see the mine.&nbsp; The Limited don&rsquo;t
reach Defiance until evenin&rsquo;.&nbsp; The mine ain&rsquo;t
but a little ways out from here.&nbsp; You might be interested in
lookin&rsquo; it over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; Brainard exclaimed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see the mine.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had been so much
preoccupied with Melody, the girl, that he had altogether
forgotten about Krutzmacht&rsquo;s interest in the Melody
mine.&nbsp; &ldquo;How far is it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About three miles back in the hills.&nbsp; The old man
was building a trolley from the mine to the smelter here beside
the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The miner pointed out the rusty rails and bleached sleepers of
the trolley road as their horses picked the way over the rough
ground up to the opening of the main shaft of the mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Defiance lies off there,&rdquo; the miner said,
pointing to the blue horizon, &ldquo;twenty-five miles in a
straight line north.&nbsp; He meant to run a railroad <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>right
across the sagebrush.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s down grade all the way, so
the cars could go out by gravity.&nbsp; They reckoned on
gettin&rsquo; power for the trolley from the river, by damming it
above the smelter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was to be developed on a big scale!&rdquo; Brainard
exclaimed, impressed by the scope of Krutzmacht&rsquo;s
plans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; the miner agreed.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
ain&rsquo;t no use to do things in a small way in this
country.&nbsp; Krutzmacht knew that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard scanned the steep, savage mountains above the
shaft.&nbsp; They were devoid of all vegetation on the lower
slopes, dull brown in color, with their flanks seamed by little
gullies.&nbsp; Behind, the higher peaks lifted their heads in
broken lines of serrated edges; and in the far distance,
glittering in the cloudless sky, were snowy tips of dazzling
white.</p>
<p>The miner picked up a piece of purplish ore from the pile
heaped high about the mouth of the shaft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that!&rdquo; he said admiringly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s enough ore of that sort right under our feet
to pay almost to tote it out to Defiance.&nbsp; And they had just
scratched the surface, here and there.&nbsp; The old man
didn&rsquo;t reckon to begin mining until he had things fixed
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They descended from the ore pile and proceeded <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>to the
entrance of the main shaft.&nbsp; It was cluttered with timber
and abandoned machinery, some of which had never been
installed.&nbsp; They spent a couple of hours examining the mine,
stumbling about the dark tunnels by the light of a candle which
the old miner had brought, looking at the ore bodies already
exposed, ready to be worked.</p>
<p>When at last they emerged into the dazzling sunlight, and were
resting, Brainard remarked wonderingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer that a man like Krutzmacht should have
abandoned a large property such as this, when he had gone so far
with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hain&rsquo;t abandoned it, I tell you.&nbsp; He paid
the taxes up to last year.&nbsp; It takes an awful sight of
money, stranger, to develop a big mine so far from the
railroad.&nbsp; Krutzmacht&rsquo;s pile wasn&rsquo;t big enough,
and he wasn&rsquo;t the kind who&rsquo;d take anybody in with
him.&nbsp; All or nothing for him&mdash;that was his way.&nbsp;
So he went back to California to get his stake.&nbsp; If
he&rsquo;s alive still, he&rsquo;ll be coming in here some day
ready to work this bonanza!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid that will never be,&rdquo; Brainard said
slowly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Krutzmacht died in New York two months
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The miner stared in astonishment, exclaiming at last:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well!&nbsp; So the old man died before he <a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>made
good!&rdquo;&nbsp; Brainard nodded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Maybe you are
looking at the property for yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I look like a miner?&nbsp; No, I came to Monument to
find out if the old man left an heir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon the only folks he had was that girl and her
mother, and one is dead and the other gone goodness knows
where,&rdquo; the old miner replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;So the Melody
mine don&rsquo;t belong to nobody now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It belongs to that girl, if we can find her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be sold for taxes before that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll buy it in,&rdquo; Brainard said
promptly.</p>
<p>They ate the bread and bacon they had brought with them for
lunch under a pine tree on a slope of the steep hill above the
mine.&nbsp; The old miner shook his head from time to time, and
muttered to himself over the strange dispensations of Providence
that left a rich mine like the Melody abandoned.&nbsp; Brainard
thought of the girl who had escaped him, and planned vaguely what
his next steps should be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an old crater up among them hills,&rdquo;
the miner vouchsafed, when the last slice of bacon and bread had
disappeared, &ldquo;and some sulfur springs.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
another fortune, maybe, if you could get at the
sulfur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a look at it,&rdquo; Brainard
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;How do you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>And
so, while the old man turned back to look after their horses,
which they had left tethered far below, Brainard clambered on
among the sharp peaks toward the snow beds that lay in drifts
along the ragged edge of the mountains.&nbsp; He passed the
circular depression of which the miner had spoken, and noticed
the yellow crust upon the earth; but for a long time he kept on
upward.&nbsp; He wanted to be alone, to think over a certain
daring idea that had seized hold of him while the miner was
showing him the neglected riches of the Melody mine.&nbsp;
Perhaps the keen mountain air, blowing dry and fresh from the
desert below, had its part in stirring his brain to unwonted
excitement.&nbsp; Perhaps it was the reaction from his
disappointment of the evening before in not finding his young
mistress waiting to receive her fortune.&nbsp; However that might
be, his idea kept teasing him, expanding all the time in
reasonableness and urgency.</p>
<p>Why should he not take up Krutzmacht&rsquo;s purpose&mdash;use
part of the money he had obtained from the bankers in developing
this great property?&nbsp; While he was prosecuting the search
for the young girl, which he foresaw might take much time, might
indeed end in failure, this work would give a new incentive, a
new meaning to his long adventure.</p>
<p><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>&ldquo;Give it all to Melody!&rdquo; the old adventurer
had whispered with his last breath.&nbsp; Yes, all to Melody in
one form or another, as soon as possible.&nbsp; He would dive
deeper than the letter of Krutzmacht&rsquo;s word&mdash;he would
do as the old man might have done himself, if his life had gone
on.&nbsp; He would fulfill his inmost purposes.</p>
<p>He had humor enough to smile at his own daring.&nbsp;
&ldquo;One Edgar Brainard,&rdquo; as he had described himself to
Krutzmacht, unsuccessful playwright, scrub of the city streets,
to run a mine!&nbsp; But why not?&nbsp; For that old self, that
&ldquo;one Edgar Brainard,&rdquo; buffeted, discouraged human
chip on the muddy surface of the stream of life, had completely
disappeared, never again to exist, he earnestly hoped.&nbsp;
These eventful weeks of vital living, constant and quick
decision, of prompt, forceful execution, of vivid feeling and yet
calm self-reliance, had made a totally other man of him&mdash;one
whose possibility he had never suspected, but one whom he liked
and respected an infinite deal more than that old, familiar
&ldquo;one Edgar Brainard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thanks to Krutzmacht and the elusive Melody, he could never
again become the timid, inefficient struggler earning his
precarious crust of bread by humiliating tasks, dreaming futile
dreams and putting them into equally futile words.&nbsp; He had
<a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>tasted
of life, action, power, and he found them sweet.&nbsp; He would
not resign them!&nbsp; Thus Krutzmacht had bestowed on the chance
stranger who had befriended him in his last need more than those
millions he was leaving to Melody.</p>
<p>His rapid thoughts swept over these last weeks.&nbsp;
Everything in them, it seemed, had prepared the way for this
decision, had fitted him to dare, to take the
responsibility.&nbsp; If it had confronted him a month before,
when he and Melody had passed each other unknown, he would not
have been ready; if it had come a fortnight before while he was
in Paris, he would not have risen to the opportunity.&nbsp; It
had come Now, at the fertile moment. . . .&nbsp; His thin, weak
body had filled out, just as his harassed face had taken on firm
lines of real manhood.&nbsp; He was no longer afraid of life, nor
of any of its chances.&nbsp; He would act for this girl as he
would act for himself; he would be her trustee, her faithful
servant, and the guardian of her property until such time as it
could be given into her hands.&nbsp; And the idle millions should
set about their proper task of breeding more millions.</p>
<p>At this point in his thinking he gave a boyish whoop that even
caught the ear of the old miner below and made him look up.&nbsp;
Brainard waved his hat and laughed from the glorious fun of it <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>all,&mdash;the risk and the joy of life,&mdash;living
at last! . . .</p>
<p>As was characteristic of the new man, having projected an
idea, committed himself to a decision, his mind at once bent
quickly to filling in the details of the pattern in action.&nbsp;
He should go to-morrow across the mountains to look for his old
friend Gunnison, to learn what more he could, if anything, about
the girl&rsquo;s sudden departure.&nbsp; Gunnison might also give
him information of value concerning the mine.&nbsp; Then he
should take the evening train for San Francisco, and there first
of all he would look up the friendly reporter Farson, to enlist
his aid in the search for the girl.&nbsp; In this he must
exercise great caution, because San Francisco might not yet be a
perfectly salubrious climate for him, nor did he wish to stir
cupidinous desires in the breasts of possible claimants to
Krutzmacht&rsquo;s fortune.&nbsp; What he should do afterwards
was not clear as yet, but he thought that Farson might be helpful
in suggesting the best methods for prosecuting such a search as
was before him.&nbsp; Hollinger, if he had returned to the
States, might also be useful.&nbsp; He would willingly confide in
the &ldquo;fight-trust magnate.&rdquo;&nbsp; In any case he
should try to find the grizzled miner from Union,&mdash;just why,
he could not say.&nbsp; But he felt that the old man who had
searched fortune in the <a name="page208"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>earth for thirty years might be
useful in &ldquo;handling the Melody proposition.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
would run across him either at the Palace in San Francisco or, if
not there, could stop at Winnemucca on his way east and make the
journey to Union.&nbsp; He had the man&rsquo;s name written down
somewhere.&nbsp; And then he must call for that trunk in Chicago,
in which he hoped to find the title deeds to the mine and other
interesting documents.&nbsp; There was much to be done, and to be
done speedily.&nbsp; Yet he felt no haste, no nervous anxiety to
be adoing.&nbsp; Time for thought was needed also. . . .</p>
<p>So he climbed on rapidly toward the glittering banks of snow
until he reached a small plateau gleaming like a jeweled robe in
the sunlight.&nbsp; Beneath him lay the little valley about the
shaft, scarred by the ore pits with their abandoned rock
piles.&nbsp; Far down, the old miner was leading the horses from
the shed where they had been tied.&nbsp; Above beckoned the
peaks, reaching into the steely heavens like naked icicles.&nbsp;
A broad-winged bird circled majestically, tracing its dark shadow
on the gleaming snow field, as with a brush.</p>
<p>Not a sound upon the earth nor in the sky!&nbsp; A broad, deep
silence!&nbsp; The clear light, the lofty peaks pointing
heavenward&mdash;nothing more, except his own beating heart!</p>
<p>The man stood there in the immense silence, <a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>his soul
poised like the hawk above his petty world, surveying in one
swift rush of thought that little self of his past, with its
small ambitions and desires.&nbsp; Up to this level the road that
Krutzmacht had opened for him had led.</p>
<p>He gazed steadily upward into the wonderful sea of blue sky,
deeper than the blue depth of the Gulf Stream, above the snowy
peaks, beyond the world, into his future.&nbsp; What he saw there
was a vision of will, man&rsquo;s will.&nbsp; He was all
will&mdash;a vitalized mass of glorious energy to conceive, to
create, to do!</p>
<p>He laughed in the cloudless amplitude of snow and blue
heavens, laughed at the small self he had left behind, writing
play pieces, making tiny scenes for a tiny stage.&nbsp; The world
was the great stage upon which he would present his
masterpiece!&nbsp; Krutzmacht had played on that stage, and
Brainard had helped him to put up a rousing melodrama at the
close.&nbsp; His own play thereon should be something
different.</p>
<p>Krutzmacht&rsquo;s will had made the fortune; his will should
take it, if need be, reshape it, and speed it to some more
perfect end than the old buccaneer of the West had ever dreamed
of.&nbsp; Where Krutzmacht&rsquo;s will had ended, his will would
start.</p>
<p>There rose, too, a vision of art as he had felt it in Paris at
dawn, beneath the towers of the <a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>old cathedral.&nbsp; And sweetly the
two united in his fecund mind.&nbsp; He laughed softly in the joy
of this vision, and his laugh tinkled strangely among the silent
mountain peaks.&nbsp; Throwing up his head to the dazzling
rampart of snow that broke the wavering azure lines of the
heavens, he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, too, will come true!&nbsp; That will be!&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ll make life our stage, and write the play in life, as
God writes upon the snows up here.&nbsp; That is
creation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard could see the old man below holding the horses by
their bridles and shielding his eyes with his free hand, as he
searched for his companion.&nbsp; And faintly, very thinly,
through the valley came the old man&rsquo;s hail.</p>
<p>Brainard gave a last, lingering look to the immensity above,
beyond, around him&mdash;the place where his great idea had been
born.&nbsp; Then he turned his steps downward, the light of
distant thoughts in his eyes, a smile upon his lips which
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen.&nbsp; Now to <i>do</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;You will meet me again before long,&rdquo; he said to
the old miner, when they parted.&nbsp; &ldquo;And then
we&rsquo;ll make the Melody sing!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>PART
II: MELODY</h2>
<h3><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>I</h3>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why I missed you in San Francisco four
years ago!&rdquo; Brainard exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because you
wanted to write a play!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He threw back his head and laughed as if the idea was
peculiarly ironical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; the ex-reporter Farson replied, with an
echo of Brainard&rsquo;s irony.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see I had always
meant to be a playwright and took to reporting to make a
living.&nbsp; When you came along and gave me that five hundred
for helping you crack the safe and get away with the contents, I
chucked the newspaper job and moved on to Broadway&mdash;been
here ever since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how has it gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farson&rsquo;s face wrinkled comically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t quite persuaded Broadway that I am
another Sardou.&nbsp; In fact the only creation of mine that ever
saw the footlights is a melodrama, founded on our adventures that
evening in Frisco.&nbsp; And I sold that for fifty dollars to a
western syndicate.&nbsp; I have never heard from it since.&nbsp;
I need hardly say it does not satisfy my aspirations.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>&ldquo;So you went back to reporting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of a kind,&rdquo; the young man replied with a sudden
attempt to become important.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am on the staff of
<i>Bunker&rsquo;s Magazine</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they sent you here to interview me!&rdquo; Brainard
laughed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bunker&rsquo;s</i> thought that the public would be
interested in your rapid rise into the limelight, and as I had
some experience in the great West they sent me to extract from
you the crude ore of a personal document article,&rdquo; Farson
explained with engaging impudence, glancing appreciatively at his
subject.</p>
<p>The interview happened to take place in the parlor of a suite
in the same large hotel on Fifth Avenue from which almost exactly
four years before Brainard had slunk away with the manuscript of
his rejected play in his pocket, and had thence wended his way
disconsolately homeward to meet the fate that whirled him on
during four years of exciting adventure.&nbsp; Numerous trunks
and other impedimenta cluttered the room, indicating that the
miner, who in the words of Farson &ldquo;had succeeded in
climbing into the limelight&rdquo; had but just arrived from
Arizona and did not yet know that he needed a man servant.</p>
<p>Through the open windows came the roar of the traffic on the
avenue, so long unfamiliar to the <a name="page215"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>miner&rsquo;s ears.&nbsp; He rose
from the table, where over a bottle of wine he had been telling
the magazine man something about the wonderful Melody mine, and
gazed out of the window into the seething stream of humanity
below.&nbsp; This unexpected meeting with the reporter of the
<i>Despatch</i> who had helped him in his first exploit with
Krutzmacht&rsquo;s fortune had brought to his memory sharply the
great contrast between his last appearance in New York and the
present.</p>
<p>His face, now adorned by a mustache and a short brown beard,
which the hotel barber had not yet had an opportunity to trim to
an artistic point, was reddened and roughened by exposure to the
fierce Arizona sun.&nbsp; His hands were large and coarse, as if
they had handled every instrument but the pen.&nbsp; His whole
person had filled out solidly, and he walked with the awkward
gait of one accustomed to the saddle rather than the motor
car.&nbsp; But what occupied his mind at this moment was the
curious consciousness of that other self, so vastly different, so
inconceivably discouraged and weak, whom he could see down below
on the pavement, dragging his thin body through the April
mist.&nbsp; Whole worlds separated the two! . . .</p>
<p>The magazine man disturbed his revery by a question.</p>
<p><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>&ldquo;You went out there after copper in the first
place, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Brainard said, turning with a twinkle in
his eyes, &ldquo;I went after copper and got sulfur
instead!&nbsp; That often happens in life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You went out there as a rank greenhorn,&rdquo; Farson
translated, &ldquo;and come back as the chief representative on
this earth of his satanic majesty,&mdash;the Sulfur
King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sulfur King!&rdquo; Brainard repeated with an
appreciative chuckle.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good.&nbsp; Are
you going to write me up for <i>Bunker&rsquo;s</i> as the Sulfur
King?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had rather have me do that than play you up as a
successful safe-breaker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farson looked at the miner with admiration mixed with a little
envy, perhaps, as one to whom splendid chances of living had
come.&nbsp; From the professional point of view Brainard would
make excellent material for eulogy as type of &ldquo;the man who
does things,&rdquo; so ardently beloved by magazine editors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do whatever you like with me,&rdquo; Brainard remarked
slowly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t make it too
wonderful,&mdash;nor explain it all. . . .&nbsp; Do you know that
four years ago, just at nightfall like this, I stood out there in
the crowd, wondering how I could best spend my last quarter for a
meal?&nbsp; <a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>I never dreamed I should be looking down from this
window some day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He chuckled quietly to himself over the picture.&nbsp; The
magazine man pricked his ears for &ldquo;the human interest
note,&rdquo; divining a life story, and hinted broadly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What really put you into mining, after you left
Frisco?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did I get to Arizona?&nbsp; Oh, that&rsquo;s a long
story.&nbsp; I went by way of Mexico and Paris and New
York.&nbsp; Help yourself to another cigar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a few moments he added in a less joking
tone,&mdash;&ldquo;I went out there in search of an heir to
Krutzmacht&rsquo;s property.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t find
her&mdash;instead I found the Melody mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to hear that story,&rdquo; Farson said
quickly, with the keen scent of the old newspaper man.</p>
<p>Brainard shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-day&mdash;perhaps sometime. . . .&nbsp; But not
for publication&mdash;that!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve given you one good
newspaper scoop four years ago, and this thing for your
magazine.&nbsp; But the other I&rsquo;ll keep for
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farson&rsquo;s face expressed a momentary
disappointment.&nbsp; But he merely remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often wondered about you ever since I <a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>helped you
aboard the ferry with that big bag.&nbsp; Got it
still?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, what&rsquo;s left of it.&rdquo; . . .</p>
<p>Frank as Brainard had become under the influences of his new
life and much as he was attracted by the careless, good-humored
young newspaper man, he could not bring himself to tell him the
intimate details of his story, which in his feelings was so much
more concerned with his unknown mistress than with himself.&nbsp;
Ever since that evening when he had stood in the abandoned house
above the Arizona desert, surrounded by the mute evidences of the
girl&rsquo;s existence, he had prosecuted vigorously the search
for the elusive Melody, using every means known to him&mdash;and
all in vain.&nbsp; There had been no clew whatever that led
beyond the railroad tracks.&nbsp; Neither in San Francisco, where
he had looked first, nor in New Orleans, where he had gone in the
hope of finding some trace of the girl&rsquo;s mother, nor in New
York, where the old German was well known, could he learn
anything definite of Krutzmacht&rsquo;s family affairs.&nbsp;
There were many who had known the business man, but as sometimes
happens the business man had admitted no one into his personal
confidence.</p>
<p>After the first few months of this search, when forced finally
to fall back upon the usual devices of <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>advertising
and employing detectives, Brainard returned to
Monument,&mdash;the spot where he had found and lost his one
substantial proof of the girl&rsquo;s reality,&mdash;and there he
had taken up the project he had conceived of working the
abandoned mine until some heir should be found.&nbsp; Into this
project he had thrown himself with all the ardor of his newly
awakened temperament and found in the struggles that ensued a
relief from the aimless hunting for the lost girl.&nbsp; As time
passed with no results from all the agencies he had used in his
search, his mind became less occupied with the vision of his
unknown mistress, and his life concentrated itself upon this
accidental undertaking,&mdash;all the more as it proved
unexpectedly difficult and failure frequently threatened.&nbsp;
His pride and good faith as well as his new manhood were
challenged in the struggle, which had only quite recently
resulted in abounding triumph.&nbsp; Now that he was free to look
about him again and direct his energy into a new channel, the
thought of Melody returned to haunt his mind.&nbsp; One of his
purposes in coming to New York was to start afresh the hopeless
search.&nbsp; An idea came to him as he talked with Farson about
the mine.&nbsp; Perhaps publicity of his success with the Melody
mine in Arizona might attract the attention of the one most
concerned.&nbsp; With this thought in mind <a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>he said to
the magazine man, turning away from the window:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you all you want to know about the
mine&mdash;you can put it in your story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave him a lively account of the vicissitudes of the great
Melody mine at Monument, Arizona, and his experiences with
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Farson summed up at the end, &ldquo;the
copper gave out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not!&nbsp; There are millions of tons of
copper in those hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what was the trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It cost too much to mine and smelt it at present
prices.&nbsp; After pouring a good bit of money into the thing, I
found that out.&nbsp; The sulfur looked promising, and we went in
for that; but that, too, came near taking our last dollar before
it made good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He told the magazine man how he had discovered traces of
sulfur in an old crater among the hills, had made tests, and had
found that the mineral existed in great quantities and almost
pure.&nbsp; But when they went after it, new difficulties were
encountered&mdash;quicksands.&nbsp; One method after another was
tried and found useless, until the experts he had summoned were
ready to give up the job.&nbsp; Then, almost in despair, Brainard
<a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>had
experimented with a novel method of extracting the sulfur by
pumping steam through one pipe into the earth and taking the
solution out by another.&nbsp; It was successful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a steady yellow stream out of the bowels of
the earth&mdash;a stream of gold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man sighed with envy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better than gold,&rdquo; Brainard continued.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A thousand per cent better!&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t dare
tell you how much money that yellow stream pours into my pockets
every twenty-four hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farson&rsquo;s eyes gleamed, and he looked covetously at the
bulging pockets of the miner&rsquo;s loose coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you made good,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and of course
you came up here to New York, straight off, to spend your
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; Brainard assented with a
laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good place to enjoy oneself.&nbsp; What
are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard looked quizzically at the ex-reporter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Get some clothes, first.&nbsp; I need &rsquo;em,
don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farson candidly admitted that he did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t seem the
sort to blow your money the usual way&mdash;chorus-girls, or
country places, or yachts, or stock market, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard shook his head vigorously at each item of
gratification mentioned.</p>
<p><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>&ldquo;What <i>are</i> you going to do with that yellow
stream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have my idea,&rdquo; Brainard admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I want to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, and you can make another article
about it, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man leaned forward, all eager attention.&nbsp;
Brainard smoked thoughtfully, then began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve written plays&mdash;got one in your pocket
this minute, probably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean you are going to write
plays!&rdquo; Farson said disgustedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my boy&mdash;not now.&nbsp; I tried it once.&nbsp;
But I hope to make it possible for you and other young men to
write their plays and get them put on the stage.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
going to build theaters, here and in other cities.&nbsp; I shall
found a national society of dramatic art.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the
way I&rsquo;m going to blow in the money from the sulfur stream
as long as it flows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; The magazine man whistled dubiously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Another uplift movement for the poor drama?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me explain,&rdquo; Brainard continued.</p>
<p>With much more eagerness than he had shown over his exploits
with copper and sulfur, he sketched the story of his great idea,
which had <a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>first taken possession of him that last night of his
week&rsquo;s stay in Paris, while he wandered through the silent
streets.&nbsp; He told of the vision that had come to him in the
snowy heights of the Arizona mountains, in the silence of earth
and sky&mdash;a vision of beautiful art that might be created
into reality by the aid of the wealth which he could give
it.&nbsp; He had set himself earnestly to the task of getting the
necessary gold out of the ground, and all through these years, in
the vigils of his lonely nights in the mining camp, he had nursed
his vision.</p>
<p>He poured out his heart freely to Farson, because he was young
and a would-be dramatist, and could understand; and Farson,
listening to the story of this idea, became warmed with the
enthusiasm of the other and forgot his habitual journalistic
skepticism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s big!&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now it will no longer be just an idea.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s to become fact!&nbsp; I have the money&mdash;at least,
it&rsquo;s mine for the present.&rdquo;&nbsp; Brainard corrected
himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;One can do something with half a million or
so a year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half a million a year!&rdquo; the young man gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More or less&mdash;at present rather more, I should
say,&rdquo; Brainard admitted carelessly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Depends on
the market for crude sulfur, you <a name="page224"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 224</span>understand.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s pretty
strong just now.&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s the copper to fall back
upon, when the price of copper goes up.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no
need to worry about the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just here they were interrupted by a boy with a card.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show the gentleman up!&rdquo; Brainard exclaimed,
glancing a second time at the card.</p>
<p>The magazine man rose reluctantly to go, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another time, if you would be good enough to tell me
more about your plans&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go!&rdquo; Brainard interrupted
warmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you are interested, stay, and you will
hear more about my great idea.&nbsp; This gentleman has come from
Chicago by appointment to talk it over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you drop that magazine job?&rdquo;
Brainard suggested abruptly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall need a
secretary.&nbsp; I think you would be the right sort.&nbsp; Why
not begin <i>now</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; the journalist exclaimed boyishly, and
they shook hands.&nbsp; This was a millionaire after his own
heart, who did things casually at the drop of the hat with the
most surprising ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have a better chance to write your
plays,&rdquo; Brainard remarked genially.</p>
<p><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>It
pleased him to think that here, on the spot where he had
experienced his last defeat, he was able to play the part of good
fortune to youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somehow,&rdquo; said Farson enthusiastically, &ldquo;I
feel it&rsquo;s going to be like a play all the time with
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chap that&rsquo;s coming up to see me,&rdquo;
explained Brainard, &ldquo;is an actor and a manager in a small
way.&nbsp; He calls himself Ferris MacNaughton&mdash;an odd
genius, a Scotsman who has played all over the world.&nbsp; I ran
across him in a small Arizona town, doing Shakespeare to the
mining camps, and doing it well, too.&nbsp; He seemed interested
in the idea, and so, when I got ready to pull out, I wired him to
meet me here.&nbsp; He hasn&rsquo;t lost any time,&rdquo; he
added as the door swung open.</p>
<h3><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>II</h3>
<p>It was a curious figure that entered the room.&nbsp; The
Scotsman was short, thick-set, about fifty years old, with a
round, bald head fringed with white hair.&nbsp; He was dressed
with an evident attempt at youthful smartness, and dangled a
small cane.&nbsp; Between his thick lips was the end of a black
cigar.&nbsp; His large face, portentous brows, and mild blue eyes
looked as if he had started as Falstaff and ended as a Scottish
Hamlet.</p>
<p>MacNaughton bowed profoundly, and said in deep, measured
tones, that were reminiscent of blank verse:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, gentlemen!&nbsp; I received your
telegram yesterday, Mr. Brainard.&nbsp; It found me at an
unoccupied moment in my career, and I am happy to place myself at
your disposal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farson grinned.&nbsp; He judged from his acquaintance with
Broadway that the unoccupied moments in the Scotsman&rsquo;s
career had been frequent of late years, and that he had spent a
good many of them in the outer offices of theatrical
managers.&nbsp; He wondered how his new employer, who seemed wide
awake enough to capture one fortune and <a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>make a
second, had come to mix himself up with this seedy actor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Brainard exclaimed genially, shaking
MacNaughton&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is my secretary,
Edward Farson&mdash;Ferris MacNaughton.&nbsp; Let us get to work
at once and see how we can spend the better part of half a
million a year on the theater!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the casual mention of this large sum of money, the old
actor did a bit of unpremeditated acting, displaying astonishment
so genuine that it set the secretary laughing.&nbsp; He recovered
himself, and remarked in his Shakespearian tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One might do a good deal on even less!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three sat down about the table, and lighted fresh
cigars.&nbsp; Brainard presently drew a small, much worn note
book from an inner pocket, and began turning its leaves, reading
thoughtfully from time to time:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Item first&mdash;create an organization that will build
and support theaters in the chief cities of the United
States&mdash;to be called in every instance &lsquo;The
People&rsquo;s Theater.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; the actor assented loudly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have always maintained that the drama came originally from the
ranks of the common people, and should be the chief means of
their education.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The magazine man made a wry face.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;People&rdquo; according to Broadway were visitors <a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>from out of
town who would pay two fifty apiece for the
&ldquo;show&rdquo;&mdash;any show.&nbsp; Brainard read on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Item second&mdash;no boxes and no reserved seats in the
People&rsquo;s Theaters.&nbsp; Highest price of seats, one
dollar, and free matinees on Saturdays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will need a million!&rdquo; Farson murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I used to find it so hard to get a good seat when I
wanted to go to the theater,&rdquo; Brainard explained.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Even when I had scooped together the price, for some
extraordinary occasion, I couldn&rsquo;t get nearer than the
twelfth row.&nbsp; Every theater was always sold up to that row,
no matter how early in the day I got to the box office.&nbsp; I
have an invention in mind that will register every seat sold or
given out, and show it on a diagram, to put an end to the usual
practice.&nbsp; But let us get to more important
matters!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He read out different items:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exchange of the different companies in the
organization&mdash;a college of dramatic art&mdash;caf&eacute;s
in the theaters&mdash;libraries of dramatic
literature&mdash;open-air theaters in the suburbs and city parks,
etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; the actor inquired sententiously,
&ldquo;what do you propose to give the people in your
theaters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plays, of course!&rdquo; Brainard replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;All <a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>sorts of plays that are worth while, old and
new!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shakespeare, Ibsen, and Hauptmann,&rdquo; the actor
remarked voluptuously.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sophocles,
Moli&egrave;re&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; Farson put in.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where will
you get the people to sit through that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear young sir,&rdquo; the actor retorted
paternally, &ldquo;the people love the <i>best</i>.&nbsp; I have
played the classics in every State in the Union to enthusiastic
audiences,&mdash;sometimes small.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; Farson murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But always enthusiastic!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must have modern plays, too,&rdquo; Brainard
added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But all the modern plays are copyrighted, and the
dramatists are under contract to Einstein &amp; Flukeheimer, and
their brethren.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll make our own playwrights,&rdquo;
Brainard replied placidly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
one!&rdquo;&nbsp; He tapped the younger man fraternally on the
knee.</p>
<p>The secretary subsided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the companies?&rdquo; the Scotsman inquired.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They make the piece!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very best actors, of course,&rdquo; Brainard agreed
enthusiastically.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pay the highest
salaries and give long contracts and pensions&mdash;that&rsquo;s
all in the scheme.&nbsp; You will help us to <a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>organize
the parent company, Mac.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give you a free
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old actor closed his eyes in a happy dream.&nbsp; He saw
himself at last as a metropolitan impresario, dealing
magnificently with the &ldquo;talent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard read on, but before he had finished the note
book&mdash;which contained a remarkable mixture of detail and
aspiration&mdash;dinner came up.&nbsp; They talked as they ate,
and they talked afterward as they sipped their coffee and
smoked.&nbsp; They became heady with enthusiasm, for
Brainard&rsquo;s imperturbable optimism and faith in his idea
were like drafts of Arizona air, intoxicating to those who lived
in lower altitudes.</p>
<p>The actor, mellowed by good food and good wine,&mdash;and more
by the confidence this new Croesus seemed to have in
him,&mdash;discoursed almost tearfully of aspirations and
ambitions suppressed through long years that were now within the
possibility of realization.&nbsp; He had always wished to devote
his life to Ibsen and the great classics, he declared, but the
box office had prevented the fulfillment of his artistic
ideals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the box office now,&rdquo; Brainard laughed,
&ldquo;and I am here to fulfill ideals!&rdquo;&nbsp; He picked up
the note book again.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had forgotten the college of
actors, for both sexes, which we must run in connection with the
enterprise.&nbsp; It will give free <a name="page231"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 231</span>tuition, of course, and there will
be scholarships for promising pupils.&nbsp; You will have to look
after that, too, Mac.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I been training lads and lassies who
couldn&rsquo;t speak the language all my life?&rdquo; the old
Scotsman burred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should recruit our road companies from the
college,&rdquo; Brainard suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will take a good deal of time to do all that,&rdquo;
Farson remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve all the time in the world,&rdquo; Brainard
retorted confidently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Make a note of that, Mr.
Secretary!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they talked on as men will talk, when it is still a matter
of words and not actions.&nbsp; Late in the evening, or rather
early in the morning, Brainard developed his plan for an outdoor
theater in some beautiful mountain spot, or on an island along
the seacoast.&nbsp; It was a bit of fairy fancy which he called
the &ldquo;Summer Festival.&rdquo;&nbsp; Every summer, for a few
weeks in August, in some sylvan spot of great natural beauty,
with a background of lofty trees and cliffs, there would be held
a dramatic festival, where lovers of the art could resort to live
for a time in the atmosphere of Sophocles, Calderon,
Moli&egrave;re, Goethe, Shakespeare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A kind of theatrical camp meeting,&rdquo; the secretary
jokingly named it.</p>
<p><a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>&ldquo;Exactly.&nbsp; Imagine an open-air theater built
upon a cliff, with the blue sea below, backed by thick trees and
a wild forest park, where the audience might stroll between the
acts and after the performance.&nbsp; Think what could be made of
such a place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the final flash of Brainard&rsquo;s vision, and they
sat for some time in silent contemplation of what was before
them.&nbsp; At last the old actor spoke in a husky voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My boy, it is sublime!&nbsp; It has come almost too
late for me.&nbsp; I cannot walk your great stage and triumph in
your triumph.&nbsp; My days are nearly over, spent in miserable
efforts to exist and not debase my noble art.&nbsp; But I can
help, and I pledge to you and to the People&rsquo;s Theater all
the strength that is left in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old Scotsman&rsquo;s eyes were moist with tears.&nbsp;
Here was another whom the great idea had touched and lifted to
unexpected heights, Brainard thought happily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have your chance to act, too,&rdquo;
Brainard remarked consolingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean to do first?&rdquo; the secretary
demanded impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Incorporate, and find an architect,&rdquo; Brainard
replied concisely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another trust!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>&ldquo;A beneficent trust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we need is publicity,&rdquo; the young magazine
man announced.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look out for
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we all need now,&rdquo; laughed Brainard,
&ldquo;is sleep.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve done enough for one
day.&rdquo;&nbsp; For the early morning procession of drays had
begun to thunder over the pavements beneath the window.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And to-day I must engage a tailor and consult with my
banker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before we go,&rdquo; Farson said, &ldquo;let us drink
to Aladdin and his sulfur lamp!&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s to Aladdin,
the Sulfur King!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They drank the toast, and another proposed by the actor:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The American Drama!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And a third which was scarcely intelligible to Farson,
although the old actor considered it quite suitable:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Melody!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they separated.&nbsp; In this gay and careless fashion
the plot was laid for pouring half a million a year into the
Sulfur King&rsquo;s great Idea.</p>
<h3><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>III</h3>
<p>The new secretary had some difficulty in convincing Brainard
of the importance of what he called
&ldquo;publicity.&rdquo;&nbsp; His own varied experience as a
newspaper and magazine writer had given him a deep faith in this
modern method of propaganda.&nbsp; He constituted himself at once
the publicity agent of the new undertaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only way to do things in this
country.&nbsp; You must scatter your idea about in the newspapers
and magazines, get people to talk about it and read about it, or
it is dead before you start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rather against Brainard&rsquo;s inclination, Farson set off
the first of a series of journalistic squibs concerning the
&ldquo;Sulfur King,&rdquo; his spectacular fortune, and the novel
manner in which he purposed to spend it, in a profusely
illustrated article in the new <i>Bunker&rsquo;s
Magazine</i>.&nbsp; Brainard submitted to this indignity because
of his desire to advertise the Melody mine and in this way
possibly attract the attention of its unknown mistress.&nbsp; But
of all the letters that came to him <a name="page235"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 235</span>after the publication of his
spectacular biography, not one was from &ldquo;Melody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The People&rsquo;s National Drama Society had not been
incorporated before the sputter in the daily press began, with
long-winded remarks by theatrical experts&mdash;actors, managers,
and critics&mdash;predicting failure and ridiculing &ldquo;the
new uplifter of the stage from Arizona.&rdquo;&nbsp; The public
yawned and skipped.&nbsp; There was nothing new in this
&ldquo;uplift&rdquo; talk about the drama; but the &ldquo;Sulfur
King&rdquo; was new, and the public was much more interested in
him and his golden stream of wealth than in his dream of creating
a popular drama.</p>
<p>All sorts of mythical tales began to appear in print
concerning his personality.&nbsp; The story that obtained the
widest vogue was that Brainard, having in his younger and
penniless days sighed in vain for the favor of a theatrical lady,
had gone off to Arizona with despair in his heart, &ldquo;struck
sulfur,&rdquo; and now had returned to build a palatial theater
on Broadway for his old flame.&nbsp; A rather obscure young
actress was named as the heroine of the tale, and the lady, when
asked about the story by reporters, failed to deny it.&nbsp;
Instead, she coyly led the newspaper men to embroider further
details on the theme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See what you&rsquo;ve got me into with your <a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>publicity
business!&rdquo; Brainard exclaimed ruefully, holding out the
morning newspaper to Farson, when the latter came for the
day&rsquo;s work to the little house on Gramercy Park into which
Brainard had moved.</p>
<p>The secretary, who had already seen the article, merely
grinned and admitted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has the cheek!&nbsp; They are all like
that&mdash;anything to get themselves talked about.&nbsp; But
it&rsquo;s all right&mdash;it helps to spread the great
idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say it did!&nbsp; Look at that!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Brainard pointed to a sack of mail that had been poured out over
the library table.&nbsp; &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s a lot more,
they tell me, at the post office.&nbsp; We shall have to open an
office and hire some clerks, or chuck it into the
fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It all helps,&rdquo; the ex-reporter affirmed, dipping
his hands into the mass with zest.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
understand the American public yet.&nbsp; It has to have Romance
with a capital R to sugar-coat any idea before it will swallow
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was pretty nearly everything in yesterday&rsquo;s
mail, from an offer of marriage to a recipe for making a
successful play, not to mention one hundred and eighty-seven
specimens of original American drama.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are a few more of the same sort,&rdquo; the
secretary laughed, tossing out a handful of bulky <a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>packages.&nbsp; &ldquo;The literary committee will have
something to do when it finds time.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tossed the manuscripts into a corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thirty-first application for position as leading
lady from an actress &lsquo;of established reputation, at present
on the Oregon circuit&rsquo;&mdash;that goes to Mac&rsquo;s
pile,&rdquo; he remarked, throwing the lady&rsquo;s letter into a
basket.&nbsp; &ldquo;Proposal of marriage, marked &lsquo;strictly
personal,&rsquo;&rdquo; he continued, handing over an envelope to
his employer.&nbsp; &ldquo;We must get out some printed forms for
acknowledgment of these&mdash;one for marriage, one for plays,
and one for positions in the company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this is publicity, let&rsquo;s try for
privacy!&rdquo; Brainard groaned, tearing the marriage letter
into bits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a new note!&rdquo; Farson exclaimed,
pausing in his swift disposal of the mail to read aloud a
letter.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Gents</span>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw in yesterday&rsquo;s Kansas City papers a piece
about your new theater.&nbsp; I think your idea is fine!&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s all right!&nbsp; Have you got a part for a beginner
who will take anything or everything, but wants to begin?&nbsp; I
know I&rsquo;ve got stuff in me, and I must see New York.&nbsp;
Please reply.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Yours anxiously,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Louisiana
Delacourt</span>,<br />
&ldquo;P. O. Box 8, Iole, Kansas.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
238</span>&ldquo;I think that Louisiana should get a chance to
see New York,&rdquo; Brainard observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She might take less than everything then.&nbsp; What do
you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put her down for the college,&rdquo; laughed
Brainard.&nbsp; &ldquo;She thinks the Idea is fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that is how Miss Louisiana Delacourt, of Iole, Kansas,
became the first pupil in the new college of dramatic art, which
was not yet founded.</p>
<p>When the second mail came in with a large assortment of
begging letters and more manuscript plays, Brainard rose in
disgust and seized his hat to flee from his own house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget Mrs. Pearmain&rsquo;s&mdash;luncheon
at half past one!&rdquo; the secretary warned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound Mrs. Pearmain!&rdquo; Brainard muttered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Just tell her I&rsquo;ve gone out of town, Ned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A look of horror spread over the secretary&rsquo;s handsome
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t do!&nbsp; She&rsquo;s to have a lot
of important people there to hear about the Idea.&nbsp; She would
never forgive you.&nbsp; It would spoil everything at the social
end,&rdquo; the young man pleaded.&nbsp; He had worked for weeks
to &ldquo;start the social business,&rdquo; as he called it, and
thus arouse an interest of a fashionable kind in their
undertaking.&nbsp; This luncheon at Mrs. Pearmain&rsquo;s was <a
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>to be the
brilliant opening of a social campaign that should go hand in
hand with the more democratic press campaign.&nbsp; It was
unthinkable for Brainard to refuse from whim or shyness or
fastidiousness the gracious advances of Society!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like all this woman business,&rdquo;
Brainard remarked sulkily, laying aside his hat.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whatever did you get us into it for, Ned?&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t need their money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t need their money,&rdquo; Farson
pronounced oracularly, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s just why
you&rsquo;ll get what you do need.&nbsp; You need their
influence.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t get anything started without the
women&mdash;not in America.&nbsp; A movement for art in any form
couldn&rsquo;t exist, if the women didn&rsquo;t take it up.&nbsp;
Why, there isn&rsquo;t any Art in any form in this country,
except what the women keep going.&nbsp; So far as literature,
drama, and music go, there&rsquo;s but one sex in America, and it
doesn&rsquo;t wear trousers either!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord!&rdquo; the young M&aelig;cenus groaned, &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t know that, Ned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good deal you don&rsquo;t know about
America and Americans that you&rsquo;ll have to learn, if you
want to make good in this thing,&rdquo; the secretary commented
severely.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you need me for&mdash;to
open your eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Brainard murmured humbly.</p>
<p><a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>&ldquo;You will find Mrs. Donnie Pearmain the very one
to give the right <i>cachet</i> to the movement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man rather prided himself on his social knowingness
acquired since his return to New York.&nbsp; Brainard sighed,
and, with a grimace, resigned himself to Mrs. Donnie
Pearmain.&nbsp; The secretary proceeded to prepare his master for
the coming luncheon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what she did for the half orphans last
year?&nbsp; The year before it was the tuberculosis
campaign.&nbsp; But now she&rsquo;s giving up mere charity for
art, and ours is the very thing to interest her.&nbsp; The Rev.
Thomson Spicer will be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The clergy, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&nbsp; They make the next best publicity
agents after the newspapers.&nbsp; They preach about popular
movements, you know.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll see what Spicer will do
for us next Sunday.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s much interested in the moral
influence of the theater upon the masses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;President Nathaniel Butterfield of Eureka University
has also promised to be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Professors?&nbsp; Ye gods!&nbsp; Where will you stop,
Ned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Butterfield has views on the educational value of
the stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not founding a religious
kindergarten!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>The
secretary, ignoring this feeble protest, consulted his note book
for further details.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jaggard, the banker, has been asked, and Toowit, of the
<i>Daily Beacon</i>, and my old boss, Howard Bunker.&nbsp; A very
representative gathering of prominent persons!&rdquo; the
secretary commented complacently.&nbsp; &ldquo;They would make an
admirable board of trustees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you propose to trustee&mdash;me?&rdquo;
Brainard roared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every movement has to have a board of trustees&mdash;a
list of good names to print at the head of the note paper, you
know,&rdquo; the young man explained patiently.&nbsp;
Brainard&rsquo;s simplicity was occasionally wearisome, and he
was proving more difficult to handle than Farson had
expected.&nbsp; It required considerable tact at times &ldquo;to
keep the &lsquo;Sulfur King&rsquo; all on the track.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He remarked to pacify his employer, &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t
interfere unless you ask them for money, and of course you
won&rsquo;t have to do so in this case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What Brainard might have said about wrapping his great idea in
a wad of distinguished trustees was prevented by the appearance
of MacNaughton.&nbsp; He came into the library at that moment,
with the air of an old diplomat, which was the r&ocirc;le he had
affected since he had joined the movement.&nbsp; His quiet gray
suit was adorned <a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
242</span>with a small red button.&nbsp; He wore horn-bowed
eyeglasses and carried a large leather portfolio.&nbsp; An
unlighted cigar protruded from his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, gentlemen,&rdquo; he remarked, settling
himself in a chair opposite the secretary and turning over the
pile of applications for positions in the companies of the new
society.&nbsp; He slowly dropped the letters to the floor.&nbsp;
&ldquo;All rotters, every one of them,&rdquo; he announced with a
profound sigh.&nbsp; &ldquo;My boy, will you please hang out the
sign, &lsquo;No lady help wanted&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure they are all so bad?&rdquo; Brainard asked
hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; the old Scotsman replied
languidly, &ldquo;there are at least three thousand women in New
York to-day, young and old, who think they can act and want a
chance to take your money.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen twenty-nine
hundred and ninety-nine of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be some good ones eager for the opportunity
we offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All those that are any good, and many that
aren&rsquo;t, have signed up with Einstein &amp; Flukeheimer and
the other managers.&nbsp; I tell you they have passed the word up
and down Broadway to have nothing to do with us.&nbsp; They call
us cranks!&rdquo; the old actor cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are
blacklisted, sir&mdash;that&rsquo;s what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>&ldquo;But with this great chance to do something for
dramatic art?&rdquo; Brainard protested, quoting from a
conversation he had had with a famous actress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The opportunity to devote themselves to their
profession, relieved of all sordid cares?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More talk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their desire to subordinate personal ambitions for the
good of dramatic art?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All talk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to double the salaries,
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even that won&rsquo;t bring the better ones who have
made names already.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t want to compromise
themselves with highbrows.&nbsp; We shall have to start with
unknown talent and build up our company gradually.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will take time, but I like it better,&rdquo;
Brainard replied optimistically.&nbsp; &ldquo;Show him
Louisiana&rsquo;s letter, Ned.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the right
spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little dear,&rdquo; MacNaughton commented
ironically.&nbsp; &ldquo;How many like her there
are!&rdquo;&nbsp; He dropped the letter in the secretary&rsquo;s
basket.</p>
<p>Presently there appeared the architect who had been asked to
prepare plans for the first playhouse.&nbsp; The three gathered
around him and examined the voluminous prints and watercolor
sketches that he had brought with him.&nbsp; He was a young man,
and he had seen his <a name="page244"></a><span

sulfur king behind him He had planned a monumental building of
marble, with beautiful colonnades, a magnificent foyer, reception
rooms, a restaurant, and a library.&nbsp; Behind, in the form of
an annex, was the college of dramatic art with its own little
theater, lecture rooms, and dormitory.&nbsp; The whole looked
like a public institution for the insane rather than a simple
theater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think it would cost to build?&rdquo;
Brainard inquired, as they came to the last sheet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think it could be done for three
millions,&rdquo; the architect replied glibly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three millions,&rdquo; the secretary repeated
easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three millions&mdash;um!&rdquo; MacNaughton echoed, as
one who dealt habitually in seven figures.</p>
<p>Brainard said nothing.&nbsp; He was thinking, perhaps, that
the Melody sulfur spring must gush like a yellow geyser to pour
forth enough gold for the Idea as it was expanding from day to
day.&nbsp; He had learned, however, not to be daunted by large
figures&mdash;the mine had taught him that&mdash;nor did he ever
allow himself to worry over expense.&nbsp; He had wasted his
youth in such fruitless cares.&nbsp; As a man he would do what he
could, and then stop.</p>
<p>Presently the three left for Mrs. Pearmain&rsquo;s
luncheon.&nbsp; The secretary thoughtfully took with him the
plans for the new theater.</p>
<h3><a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>IV</h3>
<p>Mrs. Donnie Pearmain, as everybody knows, is the only daughter
of old Joseph P. Barton, the founder of the milk trust, and
derived her very ample personal fortune from that famous
financier&rsquo;s successful manipulation of the milk
market.&nbsp; Starting as a plain New Jersey farmer, who peddled
his own milk, Barton organized the great trust, and when he died
was its largest individual stockholder.&nbsp; It was he, too, who
first generally introduced the use of the small glass bottle
instead of the large tin can in the distribution of milk, thereby
enabling the trust to add at least thirty per cent to the retail
price of its product.</p>
<p>In spite of these accomplishments, financial and hygienic,
Barton was one of the most widely misunderstood and execrated of
the older generation of millionaires, doubtless because of the
abnormal increase in cost of this necessary article of domestic
consumption, and its deterioration in quality, since the
formation of the milk trust.&nbsp; Consequently, although
Barton&rsquo;s daughter had married into glue&mdash;one of the
Pearmain sons&mdash;which is, of course, an eminently quiet and
<a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>respectable fortune that has escaped the keen eyes of
the muckrakers, she had never been able wholly to live down the
taint of milk.&nbsp; Too many even of the social leaders of the
city remembered the small bottles of Barton&rsquo;s pale-blue
fluid, retailed as milk at nine cents a quart, to forgive the
social ambitions of Mrs. Donnie Pearmain, in spite of her
respectable veneer of glue.</p>
<p>The energetic little lady, however, had learned from her rich
father his great life axiom&mdash;if you can&rsquo;t do what you
want in one way, you can in another.&nbsp; So she attacked the
citadels of social leadership by the way first of Philanthropy
and now of Art, as the magazine man had accurately related to
Brainard.&nbsp; Thanks to her energy as patroness in these allied
fields, she was in a fair way of living down at last the odor of
milk and attaining the coveted reward of social leadership.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pearmain had received Edgar Brainard most graciously in
the previous interviews that had been arranged between them by
the young secretary, and had shown a most intelligent interest in
his scheme of creating a People&rsquo;s Theater.&nbsp; The young
sulfur king appealed to her all the more because he expected no
financial assistance in developing his hobby.&nbsp; She would not
be called upon to pour any milk into this philanthropy.</p>
<p>She did not in the least doubt that Brainard&rsquo;s <a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>controlling
purpose was the same as hers&mdash;to become properly known in
society by identifying himself with a popular cause, and she
commended his sagacity in taking this means of living down
sulfur.&nbsp; Therefore she had easily been brought to lend her
influence to the Idea.&nbsp; At Farson&rsquo;s suggestion, she
had gathered together, in her great house on the upper avenue, a
most distinguished luncheon party, which, as the secretary had
shrewdly said, would give &eacute;clat to any letterhead.</p>
<p>When Brainard arrived, with his companions, he was shown into
the picture gallery, where Mrs. Pearmain was chatting with her
guests.&nbsp; He was immediately presented to each one.&nbsp;
They examined him with curiosity, for even in New York a young
man with an annual income of more than half a million, which he
desires to spend upon the public, is not a common phenomenon.</p>
<p>The university president, who looked like a banker, was
especially affable, and stuck closely to Brainard&rsquo;s
side.&nbsp; Dr. Butterfield sincerely regretted that he had not
had the good luck to capture this young Croesus before he had
committed himself to this freakish idea about the drama, and
hoped that there was still some stray million which he might
divert into the channels of the higher education at Eureka.&nbsp;
<a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>It was
for this purpose that he had torn himself away at midday from his
many duties at the university.&nbsp; The other guests,
understanding the game, looked on with sympathetic smiles.</p>
<p>Brainard had spent two dreary years at Eureka where he had
found little to relieve the ignominy of his dire poverty, and
thus he knew something about &ldquo;old Nat,&rdquo; as the head
of that institution was familiarly known among the
undergraduates.&nbsp; When in the course of their conversation
Brainard admitted that he had been enrolled at the university,
Butterfield beamed upon him with a new warmth and remarked
eagerly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How interesting!&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know that you
were a Eureka man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t graduate,&rdquo; Brainard confessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s too bad!&nbsp; I presume you left
college for the more arduous education of a business
career?&rdquo; the college president suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left it to earn a living,&rdquo; Brainard replied
simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; the president said with a deprecatory
cough.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I meant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made a mental note of the fact that Brainard had been a
student at Eureka.&nbsp; The university should be able to use
that happy fact; the trustees might consider it proper to bestow
an honorary degree upon this distinguished half <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>son, who
had somehow managed to achieve fame and wealth after deserting
the maternal halls.&nbsp; And immediately he began to compose in
imagination a few of those celebrated periods with which he was
accustomed to bestow academic honors upon similar practical
&ldquo;sons of Eureka.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you find time to come out to us some
day?&rdquo; he inquired deferentially.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sure the boys will be delighted to welcome you back to your old
home.&nbsp; A little address at chapel?&nbsp; It is a great
inspiration for young men thus to come into touch with persons
who have made their mark in life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard merely laughed.&nbsp; He remembered a number of
occasions when &ldquo;old Nat&rdquo; had introduced distinguished
visitors to the academic audience in somewhat similar words. . .
.</p>
<p>At the luncheon Brainard was seated between the college
president and his hostess.&nbsp; He easily recovered from his
natural shyness and talked fluently of Arizona and sulfur.&nbsp;
The others listened deferentially to him, and in the many subtle
ways that these people understood of testifying their
consideration for a promising man he was made to feel
welcome.</p>
<p>The banker, who had already put him on his list of capitalists
that might be interested in some &ldquo;undigested&rdquo;
railroad bonds his house had on <a name="page250"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 250</span>their hands, was especially
attentive.&nbsp; Indeed there was something of a contest for the
guest&rsquo;s attention between the banker and the university
president, who each understood the other only too well.&nbsp; The
banker, of course, did not commit the crudity of talking finance
or even business; instead he discussed &ldquo;public
service&rdquo; and &ldquo;the new spirit of capital.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The kindly gleam of his shrewd blue eyes seemed to say to
Brainard,&mdash;&ldquo;You are one of the new kind, who will do
everything for the dear Public!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so before the succession of excellent courses had gone
far, Brainard had forgotten his distaste for the social side of
life, which he had expressed so vigorously to Farson that
morning, and really believed that all these good people were as
eager as he was to give the American public a superior form of
dramatic art at prices within the reach of the poorest.&nbsp; And
when he began to talk to the company at the conclusion of the
luncheon, after a few words of flattering introduction from the
hostess, he had no trouble in finding what he wanted to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, you will forgive me if I say a word about
myself, by way of introduction,&rdquo; he began, with an engaging
smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;Four years ago, just about, I was here in New
York, down and out&mdash;a poor, discouraged scribbler, earning a
precarious <a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
251</span>existence by writing furniture advertisements, and
sneaking into the upper gallery of a theater when I could get the
price of an admission ticket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The magazine man, at the farther end of the table, writhed
uncomfortably over this introduction.&nbsp; Why, he said to
himself, go back&mdash;so far back?&nbsp; But the others seemed
much interested, and as Brainard went on with his personal story,
describing, in simple, straightforward language, life as he had
lived it on the other side of the fence&mdash;its monotony and
sordidness, its lack of interests that relieved from toil and
worry&mdash;it was apparent that he had hit upon the best way to
secure the attention of these people.&nbsp; There were some
present, like Butterfield and Haggard, who had begun very near
the beginning, and these liked to feel again the unmeasurable
distance that separated them from their former state.&nbsp;
Others, like Bunker and Mrs. Pearmain, thought the story so
&ldquo;picturesque&rdquo; or &ldquo;dramatic.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
served to increase their complacency at not &ldquo;having been
through all that, you know.&rdquo;&nbsp; To Toowit of the
<i>Beacon</i> and the few of a middling prosperity the tale of a
rich man&rsquo;s marvelous rise was exasperatingly titillating to
the nerves.</p>
<p>Brainard touched briefly on the dramatic occurrence that had
suddenly lifted him into action.&nbsp; <a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>His
auditors looked as if they would like to hear more of this; but
he paused after saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go into that.&nbsp; It made another man
of me&mdash;the man you see here now, that&rsquo;s
all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few moments he resumed, throwing back his head:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friends, I have had a vision!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; thought the secretary, &ldquo;why
doesn&rsquo;t he come to the point?&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t want
to hear about his dreams!&rdquo;&nbsp; But with that simple
earnestness which was the most characteristic quality in his
developed character, Brainard persisted in his effort to share
his idealistic enthusiasm.&nbsp; He concluded his confession of
faith with the words,&mdash;&ldquo;It is not mere amusement, my
friends, that I wish to further&mdash;it is life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Butterfield nodded his head approvingly at this
point.&nbsp; He had said something not unlike this a few weeks
before, when his college dedicated a new hall, the gift of a
whisky millionaire.&nbsp; But the editor of the <i>Daily
Beacon</i> looked thoroughly bored, and presently slipped
away.&nbsp; All this idealistic talk was merely angel food for
ladies and parsons, he seemed to think.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promised myself,&rdquo; Brainard continued,
&ldquo;that if I were ever free to do so, I would give myself
wholly to this Idea&mdash;give myself and all that I <a
name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>could
command of resources to found a national theater worthy of our
great people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, taking his little worn note-book from his pocket,
Brainard ran rapidly over the details of his plan, most of which
we have already learned.&nbsp; The magnitude of the scheme seemed
to appeal at first to this fashionable audience; they were
accustomed to deal in large figures, complex enterprises, and
size stimulated their imaginations like alcohol.&nbsp; Oddly
enough, it was only when he mentioned a small detail&mdash;the
low, fixed scale of prices to be charged at the
theaters&mdash;that the first dissenting voice made itself
heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will pauperize the people!&rdquo; the banker
objected.&nbsp; That, he urged, was the trouble with so many
humanitarian movements; they deprived the poor people of the joys
of competition.&nbsp; The point passed, however, after a feeble
discussion.&nbsp; That was a detail evidently to be settled later
when the exigencies of deficits would doubtless force a more
practical view upon this enthusiast.&nbsp; But a chorus of
objections rose when Brainard said that the theaters were to have
no reserved seats and no boxes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No boxes!&rdquo; Mrs. Pearmain murmured, as if
personally affronted.&nbsp; &ldquo;But where shall <i>we</i>
sit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where the others do,&rdquo; Brainard replied
promptly.</p>
<p><a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>Significant glances were exchanged about the
table.&nbsp; Was this a socialist who had slipped in among them
in disguise?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think what the opera would be without the boxes!&rdquo;
a large bejeweled woman whispered to her neighbor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are to be the people&rsquo;s theaters!&rdquo;
Brainard remarked somewhat sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hadn&rsquo;t understood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where will your theater be in New York?&rdquo; some one
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is yet to be decided.&nbsp; I am looking into the
matter to determine where the largest number of people can most
easily reach a theater by the transportation system of the
city.&nbsp; Somewhere on the lower West Side, I
suspect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody will ever go down <i>there</i>!&rdquo; several
protested.&nbsp; &ldquo;Everything is going up town all the time.
. . .&nbsp; The Opera is too far away. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody can get there most cheaply and easily,&rdquo;
Brainard returned.</p>
<p>From this point interest waned visibly, and the company merely
gave a polite half attention to the remaining notes, including
the plan for a great summer festival of drama.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds like a Chautauqua,&rdquo; Butterfield
superciliously remarked.&nbsp; He detested these <a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>popular
efforts for education, regarding them as &ldquo;scabs&rdquo; on
the genuine industry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be exceedingly drafty, an open-air theater in
the American climate,&rdquo; said an old gentleman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Think of a Bar Harbor fog!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When these trivialities had passed, Brainard hastily read a
few notes on the ideals of the enterprise&mdash;the careful
staging of plays, the giving of classics, the revival of old
plays, the need for purity of speech, something about poetic
plays and the new drama.</p>
<p>As he read, there were signs of impatience.&nbsp; At the close
came the hard, round voice of the Rev. Thomson Spicer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of plays, may I inquire, Mr. Brainard, do you
propose to give in your theaters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All sorts,&rdquo; Brainard replied, surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust there will be a strict moral
censorship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you, Dr. Spicer,&rdquo; Mrs. Pearmain
added in a severe tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;The greatest care should be
taken not to incite the people to discontent with their
lot.&nbsp; Many of the plays given to-day are most dangerous in
their tendency.&nbsp; They hold us up to ridicule, and even
criticize our morals and our fortunes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was here that Brainard committed his unpardonable blunder,
and the secretary knew <a name="page256"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 256</span>that he had finally &ldquo;queered
himself&rdquo; with these influential people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said sternly, &ldquo;that the people
should be the judge of what plays they want to see.&nbsp; You
would not try to tell them what to eat or drink, would you, Mrs.
Pearmain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an unfortunate allusion, perhaps, though
unconscious, in the word &ldquo;drink&rdquo;; for that was
precisely what Joseph Barton had done to the people&mdash;he had
made them drink a very inferior grade of blue-white fluid called
milk.</p>
<p>Brainard was rebuked by a stony silence, for his unintentional
<i>faux pas</i>, and then there burst forth a flood of
criticism.&nbsp; For an hour these good people tore to tatters
the fabric of his dream.&nbsp; There seemed to be a perplexing
double fire of objections.&nbsp; A few, the Reverend Spicer among
them, felt that Brainard&rsquo;s ideas about the sort of dramatic
art suited to the people were dangerous and anarchistic.&nbsp;
Unless such a scheme were carefully hedged in by a sound
conservatism, it might work more harm than good.&nbsp;
Others&mdash;and these were in the majority&mdash;asserted that
it was altogether a mistake to found a people&rsquo;s theater on
the level of the people.&nbsp; Art was always aristocratic, they
maintained, and the people should be invited guardedly to partake
of the intellectual entertainment provided for them by their <a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>superiors
in a playhouse situated where the best classes could patronize
it, with obscure galleries to which the commonalty might
penetrate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must appeal to the intelligent classes,&rdquo; the
college president told Brainard dogmatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; he asked caustically.</p>
<p>Thereafter he sat silent, and did not answer any of the
comments made.</p>
<p>At this point Farson circulated the plans for the new theater,
in order to create a diversion, if possible, and explained to a
little group the design of the grandiose edifice.&nbsp; Here the
banker, who prided himself on his knowledge of architecture, took
a hand and condemned the plans severely as &ldquo;mixed in
style,&rdquo; &ldquo;not indicative of the purpose of the
building,&rdquo; and so on.</p>
<p>The sheets passed up and down the drawing-room, to which the
party had adjourned, and were ogled by fine ladies with
lorgnettes, until Brainard rose, and, bowing to his hostess,
prepared to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so interesting, your plan, Mr.
Brainard,&rdquo; Mrs. Pearmain gushed; &ldquo;but I think you
must modify some of your ideas.&nbsp; You must start from
<i>above</i> always, and work <i>down</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I shall, when I discover what is above,&rdquo;
he retorted.</p>
<p>The secretary gathered up the plans, and <a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>overtook
Brainard in the hall.&nbsp; MacNaughton was already there.&nbsp;
The old actor&rsquo;s face was very red; he had not said a single
word all the afternoon, and his self-control was making him
positively apoplectic.&nbsp; He stalked majestically past the
footman, metaphorically shaking the dust of the milk-trust
millions from his feet as he crossed the threshold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Asses, fools, imbeciles!&rdquo; he cried, as the three
reached the pavement.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do <i>they</i> know about
the drama?&nbsp; About anything but food and drink?&nbsp; They
want us to build a theater for <i>them</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather a frost, wasn&rsquo;t it, Ned?&rdquo; Brainard
observed, smiling humorously at the secretary.</p>
<p>Farson said nothing; he was too utterly depressed for
words.&nbsp; The great social engagement on which he had counted
so much had utterly missed fire, and he blamed himself for the
fiasco.&nbsp; He should have written Brainard&rsquo;s remarks for
him and rehearsed him carefully beforehand, thus guarding against
the &ldquo;bad breaks&rdquo; that his employer had been guilty
of.&nbsp; And yet he had not expected to encounter such stiff
prejudice, such conservatism as took offense at trivialities, and
stuck fast on some nonessential detail.&nbsp; But his experience
with the &ldquo;patron&rdquo; class of society had not been
large.</p>
<p><a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>They
walked back to Brainard&rsquo;s little house, and all the way the
old Scotsman delivered himself of invective against the leisure
class.&nbsp; Brainard remarked once:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a democracy, so called!&nbsp; Art is to be
handed to the public on a gilt plate by the upper
classes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed sardonically.</p>
<p>When they entered the library, the fire was burning cheerily
on the hearth.&nbsp; Brainard, taking the roll of plans from his
secretary, glanced at the elaborate blueprints and water-color
sketches of the palatial theater, which might be built for three
millions.&nbsp; Slowly he poked the roll into the flames, and
watched it burn until the last bit was licked up.&nbsp; His
companions looked on in consternation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not going to give up?&rdquo; Farson asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry for this afternoon,&rdquo; the young
man said apologetically.&nbsp; &ldquo;How could one
tell&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t regret
it.&nbsp; They taught me a lot&mdash;a whole lot,&rdquo; Brainard
mused.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was worth while for that.&nbsp; We shall
learn all along the way, all of us.&rdquo;&nbsp; After another
silence he roused himself suddenly, and said, with characteristic
optimism and good humor: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been too much
talk&mdash;let&rsquo;s get to work!&nbsp; <a
name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>You, Mac,
go ahead and engage the best company you can get together for
love of art or of money.&nbsp; I will attend to building the
theater.&nbsp; Farson can read those.&rdquo;&nbsp; He pointed
whimsically at the pile of plays in the corner.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let publicity take care of itself for a
time.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
261</span>V</h3>
<p>It was very nearly a year from the day of the disastrous
luncheon at Mrs. Pearmain&rsquo;s before the new theater was
ready for rehearsal of the first play.&nbsp; The year, as
Brainard had foreseen, had been replete with education, if
nothing else.&nbsp; To find a suitable site for a popular
playhouse, to erect thereon a pleasing building, commodious and
attractive in design, and to engage a competent body of actors,
would not seem a tremendous task.&nbsp; It had been done before;
in fact, Messrs. Einstein &amp; Flukeheimer, and their fellows,
were doing it all the time.&nbsp; But the amateur with ideas and
ideals was at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Brainard had chosen the site, which was removed from the
theater district but quite accessible&mdash;in fact, not far from
the side street where he had once lodged.&nbsp; As the result of
a large search he had discovered an architect who would devote
himself to making a useful and suitable building instead of
exploiting his patron&rsquo;s purse, and together they had worked
over the plans until a satisfactory theater of modest proportions
was evolved.&nbsp; It was decided to postpone the <a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>starting of
the Actors&rsquo; College until the general scheme had
established itself.&nbsp; Almost all the other features of
Brainard&rsquo;s model playhouse for the people were included in
the plans.</p>
<p>The site bought and the plans finished, Brainard thought that
his difficulties in regard to the building were over, but in fact
they had not yet begun.&nbsp; There was one strike after another
upon the building from the excavation up, with an annoying
regularity and persistence.&nbsp; They were usually ended by a
compromise, which consisted in Brainard&rsquo;s paying a
contractor a slight increase in contract price, to
&ldquo;square&rdquo; some union or labor leader.&nbsp;
MacNaughton, whose imagination was much given to plots and dire
machinations of the enemy, held that these labor troubles
emanated from the offices of Einstein &amp; Flukeheimer in upper
Broadway.&nbsp; Farson and Brainard tried to convince him of the
folly of this delusion, telling him that the noted managers
probably had enough troubles of their own to keep them busy, and
indeed would doubtless be glad to give the People&rsquo;s Theater
one of their own empty playhouses for a reasonable consideration
if Brainard would take it off their hands.&nbsp; But they could
not convince the Scotsman, who would go to Brainard&rsquo;s house
at all hours with mysterious information about the plot, which
had to be confided in deep <a name="page263"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 263</span>whispers.&nbsp; He had thought it
all out in his own mind and believed that their hated rivals were
working through the powerful agency of the Catholic Church.&nbsp;
He said that was their favorite weapon when they wished to put
any rival out of business or ruin a promising star, who had
refused to listen to their offers.</p>
<p>When Brainard on his return from a hurried trip to Monument to
inspect the mine found all work suspended upon the theater
building, he was almost inclined to take Mac&rsquo;s view of the
plot against the People&rsquo;s.&nbsp; This time it proved to be
a dispute between two rival unions over the job of electric
lighting.&nbsp; The contractor had given the work to the regular
union, and the union of theatrical electricians had declared
war.&nbsp; Every workman was called out.&nbsp; Brainard&rsquo;s
patience was exhausted, and he would not listen to the usual
proposal for compromise suggested by a suave &ldquo;business
agent.&rdquo;&nbsp; Instead he telegraphed his manager in Arizona
to send up at once old Steve and the &ldquo;emergency
gang,&rdquo;&mdash;the name by which a choice collection of
spirits under the command of the old miner Steve operated either
as miners or strike breakers.&nbsp; On the third day they
arrived,&mdash;twenty lean and lank specimens from the plains, in
sombreros and riding boots, prepared for immediate action.&nbsp;
They did not <a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>know much about gas fitting, electric wiring, tile
laying, and allied trades, but they took possession of the
unfinished building with an unconcern that created a sensation in
labor circles, and before long work had begun again and this time
was pushed uninterruptedly towards a belated conclusion&mdash;all
under the careful supervision of the &ldquo;emergency
gang,&rdquo; who rolled cigarettes and spat upon the premises,
while they discussed the drama with MacNaughton.</p>
<p>This prompt action by Brainard raised him highly in the esteem
not only of the contractors and workmen, but of his associates in
the venture.&nbsp; They saw that beneath his good nature and
smiling placidity, he was a man to be reckoned with who meant to
carry out his purposes.&nbsp; After this final flurry he took
more pleasure in watching the work on the building, and thus
realizing as far as the outside went his old dream.&nbsp; It
would be, he flattered himself, the most delightful and
convenient recreation center in the city,&mdash;not merely a
garish, ugly auditorium where the largest number of unfortunates
possible would be packed into the smallest area. . . .&nbsp; At
last the building was sufficiently near completion to permit the
beginning of rehearsals. . . .</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>On his way to the first general rehearsal Brainard stumbled
over the marble workers, who were <a name="page265"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 265</span>laying the mosaic floors with what
seemed incredible deliberation.&nbsp; At this rate, push the work
as he might, the theater would be a rough barn on the night of
its opening to the public, which had been announced for the first
of December.&nbsp; It was easier to capture a fortune and develop
a great mine than to build a playhouse in America!&nbsp; That
gave him something to think of.</p>
<p>He dropped his coat and hat in the pleasant library on the
second floor, where the carpenters were languidly putting up
bookcases.&nbsp; He had watched these same carpenters at their
work for a number of weeks and had marveled at their grudging
slowness of movement.&nbsp; Certainly they were not touched with
enthusiasm for the great Idea, although the philanthropic object
of the building had been carefully explained to them.&nbsp; Some
of these carpenters lived in the neighborhood, and the theater
was designed to give pleasure to them and their wives and their
children&mdash;it was to be their playhouse.&nbsp; And yet they
seemingly took no more interest in it than they would in the
Octopus Building farther down town, on which they would be
employed next.&nbsp; Brainard himself had put much more than
money into every detail of the place; he had given it loving
thought and care, and he wished a beautiful product which should
reflect that spirit in every line <a name="page266"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 266</span>and tone,&mdash;something intimate
and lovely and human.&nbsp; But nothing of all this could he
evoke in workman or contractor.&nbsp; It was all just
&ldquo;business,&rdquo; to be skimped and shirked wherever
possible.&nbsp; With a sigh from these reflections, thinking
dubiously of the state of mind it betrayed in that
&ldquo;public,&rdquo; on which he was counting so hopefully, he
turned toward the stage.&nbsp; It gave him a thrill of real
pleasure to push aside the heavy hangings and enter the
mysterious darkness of the empty auditorium.&nbsp; At least this
was real!</p>
<p>In the bare spaces of the undecorated stage, with a background
of white brick wall, the new company was rehearsing
<i>Lear</i>.&nbsp; It had been Brainard&rsquo;s idea to open with
what he considered to be the greatest play of the greatest
English dramatist,&mdash;to be followed, he hoped, by a new
American comedy.&nbsp; Thus the new company would pay their
respects both to the past and to the future.&nbsp; Farson had
tried to dissuade him from attempting <i>Lear</i>, saying
lightly,&mdash;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to queer us with the
profession at the start.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Brainard, whose first
conscious interest in the drama had been aroused by a performance
of <i>Lear</i> by the elder Salvini, which he had witnessed with
his father in the hazy years of his youth, clung to his
idea.&nbsp; Perhaps the part of Cordelia also touched his feeling
for that lonely <a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>girl, whose memory in some way this undertaking was to
commemorate.&nbsp; And MacNaughton came to his support in the
discussion with Farson, assuring him of the popular triumphs he
had scored throughout the West in this masterpiece.</p>
<p>It was not until the parts were to be assigned that Brainard
discovered the reason for the old actor&rsquo;s unshaken faith in
the ability of the people to rise to <i>Lear</i>.&nbsp; He wished
to play the title r&ocirc;le himself, and had broken into tears
when forced to yield to a more suitable actor.&nbsp; It had been
a very painful incident, and also an enlightening one, to the
inexperienced patron of the theater. . . .</p>
<p>At the moment of Brainard&rsquo;s arrival this morning, little
Margaret Leroy, who, for the lack of a better actress, was their
present leading lady, was languidly reciting Cordelia&rsquo;s
lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>No blown ambition doth our arms incite,<br />
But love, dear love, and our aged father&rsquo;s rights,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a few moments a voice with a beery tang boomed forth
heavily into the dusky auditorium:</p>
<blockquote><p>Aye, every inch a king;<br />
When I do stare, see how the subject quakes!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point Brainard had his first misgivings.&nbsp;
Perhaps, with their present company, <i>Lear</i> was
overambitious.&nbsp; It gave him a pang to <a
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>realize
that the faded little Leroy, with her childish blond wig, was the
best actress they could secure.&nbsp; She had had a quarrel with
her manager at the opening of the season, because he wanted to
send her to Omaha, in somebody else&rsquo;s last season&rsquo;s
success, and had accepted the offer of the People&rsquo;s Theater
in a fit of pique, and with obvious reluctance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It queers one so with the profession,&rdquo; she had
told Farson confidentially.</p>
<p>She had insisted upon bringing along with her that ancient
idol of the matin&eacute;e, Dudley Warner.&nbsp; He was doing
<i>Lear</i> in the style of <i>Beau Brummel</i>, in which he had
made his last tour on the road.</p>
<p>As Brainard listened to the shrill pipings of Cordelia
answered by Warner&rsquo;s beery bass, his heart sank.&nbsp; He
recalled all the rebuffs he had received from the better players
whom he had approached&mdash;their insincere and voluble
sympathy, their flimsy excuses, and the selfish fears that kept
them from offending Einstein &amp; Flukeheimer, in spite of the
generous salaries and all the other temptations Brainard could
think of to win them to the cause of art.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe your gold mine will give out, or you will get
tired of the stage,&rdquo; one well-known actress had said to him
pertly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Anyway, Einstein <a name="page269"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 269</span>has promised to put me on in one of
Dudu Smith&rsquo;s plays, and that&rsquo;s good enough for
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The People&rsquo;s would have to do the best they could with
second-rate and third-rate people until they had &ldquo;made
good,&rdquo; or could train their own actors, Brainard
reflected.&nbsp; Meanwhile Miss Leroy continued to pipe and
Dudley Warner to bawl, interrupted now and then by
MacNaughton&rsquo;s resonant voice from the wings &ldquo;No,
no!&nbsp; That won&rsquo;t do at all.&nbsp; Begin that once more,
Miss Leroy,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s rotten!&nbsp; Cut it out!&rdquo; a voice
murmured out of the darkness close to Brainard.</p>
<p>The fresh young voice so near to him startled Brainard, and he
turned to see who had spoken.&nbsp; In the gloom he could make
out a girl sitting hunched up, with crossed legs, a newspaper on
her lap, from which she seemed to be eating her luncheon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> pretty rotten,&rdquo; Brainard
admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole bunch is no account trash, anyway,&rdquo; the
young person continued impersonally, dangling a slice of sausage
before her mouth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Like last year&rsquo;s grass or
yesterday&rsquo;s supper.&nbsp; But that Jenny!&nbsp; Why, she
couldn&rsquo;t decorate a cemetery properly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon, having disposed of the company, the young woman
devoted herself unreservedly <a name="page270"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 270</span>to her food, ignoring
Brainard&rsquo;s presence.&nbsp; The next time that the stage
manager opened a discussion with Miss Leroy that promised to last
for some moments, Brainard turned to the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon my curiosity,&rdquo; he said, taking the seat
behind her, &ldquo;but I should like to know how you happen to be
here at the rehearsal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&nbsp; Why, I belong!&rdquo; she replied, with a
funny wrinkling of her small lips.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m part of
it&mdash;this great uplift movement for the American
dr&aacute;-ma!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard winced at the gibe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that what they call us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a lot of other things,&rdquo; the young woman
admitted frankly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Highbrows and amateurs and
boneheads and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know you, and I thought I had met every
one in the company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in the front row, you see.&nbsp; I am
what they call a nee-o-phyte&mdash;a pupil in the Actors&rsquo;
College, when there is any college.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I remember now!&rdquo; Brainard said, recalling the
first and only pupil enrolled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your name
is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Delacourt&mdash;Louisiana Delacourt,&rdquo; the girl
rolled out with gusto, as if she enjoyed her name, and
hadn&rsquo;t many opportunities of using it.</p>
<p>The slightly Southern accent of the girl set <a
name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>puzzling
currents of memory at work in Brainard&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; He
looked at her more closely, but in the dim light of the
auditorium could not make out distinctly the face which was
shrouded in one of the inverted &ldquo;peach-basket&rdquo; hats
of the period.&nbsp; She seemed a slight little body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; Miss Delacourt remarked confidentially,
&ldquo;I bet I could show that wiggle-tailed Flossie a stunt or
two!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know <i>Lear</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I know <i>Lear</i>?&nbsp; I was nursed on
Shakespeare.&nbsp; My mother knew the plays by heart, and used to
recite &rsquo;em all over.&nbsp; Mr. Farson says he&rsquo;ll get
me a boy&rsquo;s part in the last act.&nbsp; Five lines&mdash;but
you&rsquo;ll see how I&rsquo;ll make &rsquo;em hum!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Farson came up to them out of the darkness of the
auditorium, and nodded to the girl, who presently slipped
off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you know Miss Delacourt?&rdquo; Brainard
observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course!&nbsp; Everybody about the place knows
Louisiana.&nbsp; Queer little piece, isn&rsquo;t she?&nbsp;
Slangy and fresh, but she knows how to handle herself. . .
.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s pretty rotten!&rdquo; he remarked cheerfully,
glancing at the stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what Louisiana said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess she knows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard and the secretary thereupon went out to lunch, and
tried to forget their troubles.</p>
<h3><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span>VI</h3>
<p>At last, amid turmoil and excitement, the opening day
came.&nbsp; Brainard and Farson had been at the theater since
early morning, doing what they could to bring order out of
chaos.&nbsp; About lunch time MacNaughton rushed up to them, his
face white with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A telegram from Miss Leroy!&rdquo; he gasped.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Doctor thinks she&rsquo;s got appendicitis.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s got Einsteinitis, all right,&mdash;that&rsquo;s what
is the matter with her!&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t raise an actress in
New York who knows Cordelia&rsquo;s lines, let alone having
rehearsed it.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll have to postpone the
opening!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that!&rdquo; Brainard said, with tightening
lips.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not if you read the lines, Mac!&rdquo;&nbsp;
The old actor stormed back and forth, snapping his fingers and
cursing with equal warmth stars and managers, the stage and
life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there some one in the company who could
take the part?&rdquo; Brainard asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one, man or woman!&rdquo; the Scotsman
growled.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re using the whole
company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Louisiana?&rdquo; Farson inquired, a
little smile wreathing his lips.</p>
<p><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
273</span>&ldquo;You mean that Kansas kid?&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
knocking about the stage somewhere,&rdquo; MacNaughton
replied.&nbsp; He had had several passages with Miss Delacourt
already, and had no great opinion of her ability except in
repartee.&nbsp; &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t thinking of that
child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s find her,&rdquo; Farson said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She knows Shakespeare by heart&mdash;her mother used to
put her to sleep on it&mdash;she&rsquo;s always getting it off
when she isn&rsquo;t ragging the show with her Kansas
slang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They found Louisiana sitting on a pile of properties, playing
with a lanky pup.&nbsp; She smiled on Farson in a friendly
fashion, and ignored the manager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what&rsquo;s broken down now?&rdquo; she
drawled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have Miss Leroy&rsquo;s stays given
warning, or did the big bass fiddle bust a string?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Miss Louisiana,&rdquo; Farson replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Quit your guying, and get ready for Cordelia.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ll rehearse you all the afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee whiz!&rdquo; the young woman remarked, rising and
yanking the puppy by the leash.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re
sudden, my dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Leroy is sick&mdash;going to have an
operation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She needed it, if ever a woman did!&rdquo; Miss
Delacourt tossed back over her shoulder as she tied the puppy to
the gilded throne.</p>
<p><a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
274</span>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll do!&rdquo; Farson whispered
encouragingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll do something,&rdquo; MacNaughton growled
gloomily.</p>
<p>It was not an auspicious outlook for the opening of the
People&rsquo;s Theater.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>At eight o&rsquo;clock that evening, the new playhouse was
fairly well filled with what the local press calls a
&ldquo;highbrow audience.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of these, not a few had
come to scoff, for from the beginning the newspapers, led by the
<i>Beacon</i>, had taken the People&rsquo;s Theater as a pet toy
with which to play during the silly season.&nbsp; It was
variously described as the &ldquo;Sulfur Extravaganza,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Cowboy Show,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Arizona
Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For ever since that fatal luncheon, the editor of the
<i>Beacon</i> had directed the most skillful members of his
celebrated stiletto gang in their sneers at Brainard.&nbsp; To
the New York newspaper mind it was simply inconceivable that a
man with a great fortune could put it to so purely childish a use
as running a popular theater.&nbsp; A few friendly souls,
however, were scattered up and down the house&mdash;those who
follow the banner of &ldquo;new ideas&rdquo; wherever it may
wave; and there were a few of the &ldquo;people&rdquo;&mdash;a
very few&mdash;on free tickets.</p>
<p>As the curtains slowly parted, Brainard, sitting alone in the
rear of the house, regretted more than <a
name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>ever that
they had attempted to open with <i>Lear</i>.&nbsp; There were
surely some in the audience whose memories, like his, would carry
them back to the godlike fury of the elder Salvini.&nbsp; What
could they make of the squat figure, the perspiring muscularity
of Dudley Warner?</p>
<p>As the fated king waddled forth and began, Brainard shut his
eyes.&nbsp; He opened them suddenly on hearing:</p>
<blockquote><p>What shall Cordelia do?&nbsp; Love, and be
silent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was Louisiana in walk and bearing,&mdash;the swagger from
Iole, Kansas,&mdash;but the voice was rich and sweet, with an
unpremeditated, girlish modulation that suggested depths of
feeling unsuspected.</p>
<p>The audience, puzzled, was respectful through Cordelia&rsquo;s
humble replies, until the young actress essayed her first long
speech:</p>
<blockquote><p>You have begot me, bred me, loved me; I<br />
Return those duties back as are right fit . . .<br />
Haply when I shall wed,<br />
That lord must take my&mdash;my&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Louisiana stumbled at the word, then brought out
triumphantly:</p>
<blockquote><p>My fist&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was a ripple of amusement.&nbsp; Miss Delacourt heard
it, flushed defiance in <a name="page276"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 276</span>an un-Cordelia-like manner, and tore
through the concluding lines.&nbsp; She got on well enough in the
short responses, but the critics were waiting&mdash;as was
Brainard, with trepidation&mdash;to see what the girl would make
of her next long speech.</p>
<p>Alas!&nbsp; Miss Louisiana sailed in, as she would have said,
to paint the lines.&nbsp; She drew herself up in all her girlish
dignity.</p>
<blockquote><p>I yet beseech your majesty,<br />
If for I want that glib and oily part<br />
To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend<br />
I&rsquo;ll do&rsquo;t before I speak&mdash;that you make
known&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A frightened look came over the girl&rsquo;s face.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She is rattled,&rdquo; Brainard said to himself,
&ldquo;and will break!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evidently the audience thought so, too, and there was a
painful hush, in which MacNaughton&rsquo;s efforts to whisper the
words from the side could be heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no&mdash;no&mdash;oh, hang it all, how does the
talk go?&rdquo; Louisiana muttered audibly, swinging on her heel
toward the wings.</p>
<p>There was a roar of laughter from the house.&nbsp; With one
contemptuous glance at the audience, Cordelia walked deliberately
into the wings, and, returning in fierce haste, finished her
speech.&nbsp; As <a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
277</span>she made her exit at the end of the scene, she jerked
the train of her dress and gave it a kick in good vaudeville
style.&nbsp; The galleries caught fire, and began to stamp and
hoot.&nbsp; Louisiana turned and distinctly made a face, as a
child might, at her tormentors.&nbsp; The applause was
furious.&nbsp; It lasted so long that to resume the play with any
degree of seriousness seemed utterly impossible.</p>
<p>At the end of the act, the manager pushed the unwilling
Cordelia out upon the stage.&nbsp; She made a sulky little bow
and another face.&nbsp; There were calls and whistles.&nbsp; She
was a hit.&nbsp; But <i>Lear</i>!</p>
<p>Brainard, laughing in spite of himself, bit his lips with
mortification.&nbsp; After this nothing could bring the audience
to take the performance seriously.&nbsp; The galleries began to
guy Warner, and to exchange repartee with the fool.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Cordelia did not appear during the next two
acts.&nbsp; When she came on at the conclusion of the fourth act,
for the affecting scene with the blind king, the gallery received
her uproariously.&nbsp; She was white, with set lips, and she
threw herself into her lines with a fine scorn of the mirthful
house.&nbsp; When her memory failed her, she cut or improvised
with fluent inspiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s acting!&rdquo; Farson whispered in
amazement to Brainard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s acting, but they don&rsquo;t know
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>For
the house, having amused itself once with Miss Delacourt, refused
to take her seriously, and was ready to explode with derisive
mirth at any unconventional gesture, any wrong accent.&nbsp; Poor
Louisiana gave them enough openings; but she held herself
steadily, and was winning her way with the sweetness of her voice
and her real charm, when, alas, there came a long, hard
line.&nbsp; She wavered, tried to bluff it out, but broke down,
burst into tears, and fled to the wings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor child!&nbsp; It was too much for her,&rdquo;
Brainard murmured, while Farson tried to hiss down the
laughter.</p>
<p>It would not down, however.&nbsp; Finally Brainard rose and
walked down the aisle to the front.&nbsp; Holding up his hand to
still the noise, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Delacourt came to us merely as a pupil.&nbsp; We
were compelled to ask her to take the difficult r&ocirc;le of
Cordelia at five hours&rsquo; notice, owing to the sudden illness
of Miss Leroy.&nbsp; I think that Miss Delacourt deserves our
thanks and our sympathy, instead of these jeers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was silence, but <i>Lear</i> was doomed.&nbsp; The
critics had left, and others followed.&nbsp; Those that stayed
until the curtain swept together for the last time snickered
contemptuously over the affair.&nbsp; Louisiana had saved the
occasion from dismal dullness; she had turned <i>Lear</i> into a
farce!</p>
<h3><a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span>VII</h3>
<p>The pleasant drawing-room and the library of the theater,
which were on the second floor above the foyer, had been thrown
open after the performance, and a few well-wishers of the
enterprise lingered there to examine the new playhouse and to
meet the shamefaced members of the company, to whom Brainard was
giving a supper.&nbsp; Miss Delacourt did not appear with the
others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s probably gone home, poor girl,&rdquo;
Farson said, as Brainard started to find her.&nbsp; He went
directly to the dressing rooms and knocked at one of the closed
doors.&nbsp; He had to knock twice before a sulky voice replied
irritably:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, come in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louisiana had torn off the blond wig in which she had played
Cordelia and tossed it into a corner.&nbsp; She had also removed
the embroidered gold bodice of her costume and put on a rumpled
dressing sack, and was sitting curled up on her long train, the
big puppy in her lap.&nbsp; She was pulling his ears; her brown
hair fell about his head.&nbsp; It was plain that she had been
crying.</p>
<p><a name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
280</span>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; she asked crossly,
recognizing Brainard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to&mdash;to thank you for helping us in our
emergency this evening,&rdquo; Brainard stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helping!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a smooth word, I must
say!&rdquo; the girl flashed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You may like that sort
of help; but it&rsquo;s the last you&rsquo;ll get from me, I
reckon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; Brainard protested heartily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You saved the performance from being just a soggy failure,
anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could not help smiling at the memory of her saucy antics,
yet the picture of childish despair she presented, crumpled, with
her hair falling about the puppy&rsquo;s head, roused another
unfamiliar feeling of sympathy and pity.&nbsp; She was such a
forlorn little person, for all the bravado of her speech!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that what you call saving it?&rdquo;&nbsp; Louisiana
turned the puppy from her lap and devoted all her passion to
scorn.&nbsp; &ldquo;Saving!&nbsp; To make yourself a guy, to be
&lsquo;it&rsquo; for the merry haw-haws of the smart Alecks in
New York!&nbsp; I must say I don&rsquo;t like your taste.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d rather fail in some other way.&rdquo;&nbsp; She pushed
back her falling hair and tied it excitedly in a knot, then
shrank into her dressing gown and glared at Brainard very much
like a kitten that has been cornered and is ruffled, &ldquo;Let
<a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>me tell
you right here, dear sir, if you are the big gun responsible for
this whole show, you haven&rsquo;t got much to be proud
of!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard you say that once before,&rdquo; Brainard
admitted humbly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You said it was rotten, and I guess
it is.&nbsp; But we are going to try to make it
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, try!&nbsp; You&rsquo;d better try.&nbsp; I
haven&rsquo;t seen much acting, but I&rsquo;ve seen road shows in
one-horse towns back in the State of Kansas that could play all
over your swell outfit.&nbsp; You think you are uplifting the
theater, do you?&nbsp; What do you know about the theater,
anyway?&nbsp; You&rsquo;d better go right out to Iole, or over in
the Bowery, and look at a ten-twent&rsquo;-thirt&rsquo; show and
learn something about play-acting.&nbsp; This young ladies&rsquo;
boarding-school sissy show&mdash;oh, why did I ever come to
you?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d have learned more in a Kansas City
variety!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She crossed the room to hunt up a cigarette, and puffed the
smoke with a disdainful shrug of her thin shoulders, walking to
and fro in the small dressing room, kicking her dress about like
a football, and generally emitting sparks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I saved your show from being too awfully
dull&mdash;at the expense of my reputation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard could not help laughing at this display of childish
vanity.&nbsp; She was a child attempting <a
name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>to be
dignified with something more than a child&rsquo;s
intelligence.&nbsp; He suppressed his laughter and let her
emotion explode.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think those writer-guys in the front row
are going to say about Louisiana Delacourt to-morrow
morning?&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll hand me the merry laugh,
that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be a deader in the profession
after this.&nbsp; Anyway, I&rsquo;ll have to make up another
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your name wasn&rsquo;t on the program, you know,&rdquo;
Brainard suggested soothingly.&nbsp; Louisiana merely cast him a
withering glance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course, our company isn&rsquo;t
what it should be yet,&rdquo; he admitted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try to give you a better
chance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to do some mighty smart
trying,&rdquo; the girl sneered fiercely.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
highbrows think all you&rsquo;ve got to do is to open a theater
and print &lsquo;Ideals&rsquo; in big letters on the program, and
the public will run to your show.&nbsp; Folks have been going to
the theater some before you undertook to uplift it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they do good work at the other
theaters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t all they might be, perhaps, but
they&rsquo;re so much more in the game than you are, Mr.
Head-in-the-Clouds, that you can&rsquo;t see &rsquo;em at all, at
all!&nbsp; And to start off with Shakespeare, of
course!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 283</span>She
sniffed outrageously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Lear</i> was a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say it was!&rdquo; she agreed with infinite
sarcasm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you look around and see
what the others are doing&mdash;what the horrid trust is putting
on?&nbsp; They know their business, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come&mdash;you are a little hard on us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean it. . . .&nbsp; Now, if you don&rsquo;t mind
stepping along, I&rsquo;m going to shake off this meal sack and
hike home to bed.&nbsp; Good-by to high art for me, thank
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard started for the door on this broad hint, but paused
with his hand on the knob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Delacourt,&rdquo; he said, facing the angry girl,
&ldquo;I came here to-night to say to you what I sincerely
believe&mdash;that you have in you the making of a fine
actress.&nbsp; I gather from what you have said about our
undertaking that my opinion means nothing to you.&nbsp; But let
me assure you that I didn&rsquo;t see your mistakes to-night as
much as the spirit and the talent&mdash;the very great talent, if
I am not mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very kind of you, I am sure,&rdquo; the girl
snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to persuade you to stay with us
against your inclination.&nbsp; In our present shape, we
can&rsquo;t give you what you need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think not!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
284</span>&ldquo;One of my purposes, however, in this enterprise
was to discover just such talent as I think you have, and develop
it.&nbsp; Perhaps, if I can&rsquo;t help you in one way to
develop your talent, I can in another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Delacourt deigned to pause in her toilette to stare at
Brainard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you have the real thing in you, even
after this one unfortunate performance.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t tell
whether the vein will hold deep, whether you have the character
to develop it thoroughly, or will be content with the superficial
success you might easily achieve in one of the commercial
theaters.&nbsp; But I want to help you to do better than
that&mdash;to give your talent a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must go where you can study&mdash;where you can see
good acting also.&nbsp; You must go abroad&mdash;to England and
France and Germany.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s eyes opened wider and wider.&nbsp; She
murmured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that would take a sight of time and money, and I
haven&rsquo;t a cent in the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have the time, at your age, and I can give you all
the money you need,&rdquo; he went on earnestly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;To-morrow Mr. Farson and I will talk the matter over with
you and decide on what&rsquo;s the best way to go about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
285</span>Louisiana threw back her head, as if to embrace the
splendid vision opened before her.&nbsp; Still gazing at Brainard
to see whether he really meant it all, or was perpetrating a
cruel joke, she gave a long sigh.&nbsp; There was something
pathetically wistful and desirous in her small face that stirred
Brainard strongly.&nbsp; He seemed to be looking into a little
starved soul that was trying to grasp the meaning of his
promise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She began and stopped.&nbsp; Her look wavered for one moment,
as if an unpleasant idea had crossed her mind and made her doubt
Brainard&rsquo;s disinterestedness.&nbsp; Brainard understood the
expression.&nbsp; Probably in her short experience of life she
had met with little real generosity from men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean exactly what I said&mdash;and nothing
more!&rdquo; he added with meaning emphasis.</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s face cleared with wonderful rapidity.&nbsp;
Once more it had the eager, wistful expression of the child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, but you are a good one!&rdquo; she exclaimed at
last, convinced of his earnestness and his singleness of
purpose.&nbsp; &ldquo;After all those fancy compliments I just
passed you, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we deserved a good part of what you said.&nbsp;
Perhaps you&rsquo;ll save the day for us again
sometime&mdash;when you come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
286</span>&ldquo;I sure hope I can!&nbsp; But not that
way!&rdquo; she blushed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You mean it all&mdash;the
study and travel?&nbsp; To go to Paris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And London and Berlin and Vienna,&rdquo; Brainard added
with a smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;And a lot of hard work, too,
remember!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That never rattled me!&rdquo; Louisiana exclaimed,
gathering the sleepy pup into her arms and hugging him until he
yelped.&nbsp; Presently she held out a hand to Brainard with an
expression on her mobile face more mature than he had yet seen
there.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some day I&rsquo;ll tell you my story, and
then you&rsquo;ll see what it means to me.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve
given me&mdash;life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He left her hastily to spare her the embarrassment of a second
fit of tears.&nbsp; In spite of all the humiliation that the
evening had brought him, Brainard returned to his house in a
happy and contented frame of mind.</p>
<h3><a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
287</span>VIII</h3>
<p>When Brainard confided to Farson the plan he had formed for
Louisiana Delacourt&rsquo;s education, the younger man looked
sharply at him for one moment as if he also suspected ulterior
motives in this unexpected interest in the young woman, who had
given the People&rsquo;s Theater such dubious notoriety by her
performance of Cordelia.&nbsp; In that rapid interchange of
glances between the two men, Brainard felt for the first time a
slight antagonism to his cheerful and companionable
secretary.&nbsp; Why should Farson immediately infer that there
was anything more than a disinterested desire on his part to help
a poor and promising girl, whom fate had rather casually thrown
in his path?&nbsp; Was it necessary that in the theater world
this should inevitably be the implication,&mdash;that there could
be no simple kindness between men and women!</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he exclaimed, with a slight smile, answering
Farson&rsquo;s glance, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you think that it would be a good thing for
Louisiana to go abroad now?&nbsp; She&rsquo;s got <a
name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>a good deal
to learn that she could learn here just as well,&rdquo; the
secretary observed evasively.</p>
<p>Brainard smiled more openly.&nbsp; It was plain enough that
the young secretary did not like the idea of losing sight of
their Kansas star, of whom he had seen a good deal in the course
of business these last months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s nothing but a kid, you know,&rdquo; he
added in an indifferent tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly!&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s just because she is so
much of a child that I think the best thing for her is to have a
lot of new experience of a totally different kind from any
she&rsquo;s likely to get over here.&nbsp; What she wants is to
grow,&mdash;not learn grammar and elocution.&nbsp; She must
develop in every way to become the actress that is in her, and
that development she will get more easily somewhere out of her
old environment&mdash;apart from all the inspiration that will
come to her eager little mind by seeing real acting and real
plays, of which there is much more just at present in Europe than
in New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you have thought it all out,&rdquo; the secretary
replied dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have thought a good deal about Louisiana since
last night,&rdquo; Brainard admitted.</p>
<p>It had occurred to him possibly in the course of this thought
that the secretary&rsquo;s growing <a name="page289"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 289</span>intimacy with the girl was not
altogether advantageous.&nbsp; His nature was too generous,
however, to entertain this consideration seriously.&nbsp; The
idea of rivalry between them for the girl&rsquo;s interest was
too ridiculous to be thought of, and yet he was forced to
recognize in himself a trace of that subtle sex jealousy that
seems inevitable wherever two men are concerned with one woman,
no matter how trivial the occasion.&nbsp; He put it summarily out
of his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t be away for always, Ned,&rdquo; he
observed good-naturedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And we must give the girl
her chance&mdash;it&rsquo;s the least we can do after encouraging
her to come on here and join our organization, isn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; the secretary agreed more
cordially.</p>
<p>When Brainard told MacNaughton of his purpose, the old actor
expressed an unfeigned and unflattering surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want to turn that silly&rsquo;s little head
for?&rdquo; he roared, flourishing his cigar.&nbsp; &ldquo;Send
her abroad to study!&nbsp; You&rsquo;d much better send her to a
grammar school or a young lady&rsquo;s fem sem where she could
learn ordinary deportment.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll never make an
actress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with you,&rdquo; Brainard replied
quickly.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the best we&rsquo;ve got
already.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
290</span>Farson watched the two with an amused smile.&nbsp; The
old actor shrugged his shoulders in mute disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t saying much either,&rdquo; the patron of
the People&rsquo;s Theater continued somewhat tartly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Cordelia wasn&rsquo;t the worst that happened last night
by any means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; the Scotsman groaned fervently.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I hope nothing as bad will ever happen to me again in this
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard&rsquo;s doubts of MacNaughton&rsquo;s fitness for his
position of manager grew rapidly from this moment into a
conviction that eventually produced difficulties in the hitherto
harmonious management of the theatrical enterprise.&nbsp; Another
disturbing current set in motion by the young person from Iole,
Kansas!</p>
<p>Brainard and Farson discussed at some length the details of
Louisiana&rsquo;s trip.&nbsp; The secretary was firmly convinced
that some sort of chaperone should be provided for the
girl.&nbsp; She needed a duenna or guardian, he said, to keep her
out of scrapes, if ever a woman did.&nbsp; When this idea was
suggested to Miss Delacourt, it received an immediate and
positive discouragement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know any female whom I could endure to
have trailing around after me,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
what&rsquo;s the use, anyhow?&nbsp; They won&rsquo;t eat me up <a
name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 291</span>over there,
I reckon.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve always managed to look out for myself
so far, and I&rsquo;m not likely to forget how now I&rsquo;ve
something worth doing to keep me busy. . . .&nbsp; No, I&rsquo;ll
go it alone, thank you, or not at all until I&rsquo;m ready to
select my own guardian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this she cast Farson a belligerent look that delighted
Brainard.&nbsp; When the secretary tried to explain in
circumspect terms the manifold dangers to which a young woman
traveling alone was necessarily exposed, she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take the pup along.&nbsp; A good dog
is worth any two chaperones in case of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard observed finally:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Miss Delacourt is right.&nbsp; She will get on
very well anywhere by herself.&nbsp; She has the habit of
independence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see!&rdquo; the young woman remarked, nodding
loftily to Farson.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are too conventional for the
theater.&nbsp; I have the habit of perfect independence, as your
boss said.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t propose to give it up in a
hurry either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this second jab at the secretary she squeezed her dog in
an ecstasy of good spirits.</p>
<p>This important question being settled, there remained merely
the plan of work and travel, which Brainard undertook to prepare
and to <a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
292</span>which he gave much careful consideration.&nbsp; Then
the passage was engaged, and the morning of the sailing the three
had a pleasant breakfast together at a little down-town
restaurant.&nbsp; Louisiana appeared in what she called
&ldquo;the proper make-up for her new part,&rdquo;&mdash;a smart
traveling costume, with fresh hat, gloves, boots, and
parasol.&nbsp; Brainard was glad to see that she had made such an
immediate and natural use of the liberal means he had placed at
her disposal through his secretary, although the transformation
worked by her new costume took away a certain quality of
primitive girlishness that was pleasant to him.&nbsp; Louisiana
was emerging rapidly from her chrysalis under the stimulus of the
opportunity he had provided for her.&nbsp; As he sat back and
watched her spar with Farson, he wondered whether the old
Louisiana would ever return from Europe.&nbsp; What sort of woman
would take the place of the girl who had made her d&eacute;but in
the most unconventional Cordelia the English stage had ever
seen?</p>
<p>At any rate everything was spontaneous in her now,&mdash;not a
trace of self-consciousness in her attitude to him as her
benefactor, and all the simplicity and directness of the child
which had first touched him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says he&rsquo;s going to write a piece for the
theater and put <i>me</i> in,&rdquo; Louisiana remarked <a
name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 293</span>turning to
Brainard.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;d better let me see it
first&mdash;I&rsquo;ll give him a few points most men writers
overlook. . . .&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll keep the theater open until I
get back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Longer than that, we hope!&rdquo; Brainard laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to make my d&eacute;but there&mdash;my real
d&eacute;but,&rdquo; she said importantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise you we&rsquo;ll keep it open for
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better fire the whole bunch and start
over,&rdquo; she observed thoughtfully. . . .</p>
<p>At the last moment, when Farson had already gone down the
gangway, the girl drew Brainard to one side and uttered the first
serious words they had had since their talk in her dressing room
the night of <i>Lear</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use saying thanks, you know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to thank me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t and I&rsquo;m not&mdash;but I
want you to know I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you&rsquo;re doing for me. . . .&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
make good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave him a lean little hand that gripped his
nervously.&nbsp; The last he saw of Louisiana Delacourt as he
went over the ship&rsquo;s side, she was <a
name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>chasing her
dog into some stranger&rsquo;s deck cabin.&nbsp; As he made his
way from the dock towards the People&rsquo;s Theater that
morning, his world seemed less gay and amusing with Louisiana out
of it.</p>
<h3><a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
295</span>IX</h3>
<p>After the inglorious failure of <i>Lear</i>, they tried <i>She
Stoops to Conquer</i>, with Cecilia Pyce, an English actress of
advancing years and a large and bony physique, whom MacNaughton
much vaunted.&nbsp; Brainard suspected that Cissie, as Mac called
her, had been the Scotsman&rsquo;s sweetheart in her palmier
days, and thus he was now paying his sentimental debts by giving
her a lucrative position at his patron&rsquo;s expense.&nbsp;
However, nothing better offered at present, and Miss Pyce at
least knew how to act in the solid old English fashion.&nbsp; The
people came sparingly, and sat in the first four rows of the big
auditorium, which was a lonesome sort of place these days.</p>
<p>It was little better when the company essayed an
&ldquo;original American play&rdquo;&mdash;as it was
advertised&mdash;that Farson had culled from the mass of
manuscripts he had examined.&nbsp; <i>May Magic</i> lasted a
week, and then fell to pieces before an audience consisting of
the author and about twenty of his friends.&nbsp; The management
could not even give their tickets away. <a
name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>At <i>May
Magic</i> the critics took final leave of the People&rsquo;s
Theater with such parting kicks as this:</p>
<blockquote><p>What in the name of common sense is the amateurish
aggregation at the so-called People&rsquo;s Theater trying to
do?&nbsp; In what sense is it a popular theater?&nbsp; The
&ldquo;people&rdquo; are conspicuous by their absence.&nbsp; The
worthy gentleman who is spending his money giving the public
fifth-rate productions of English classics and such rejected
modern masterpieces as <i>May Magic</i> had better go over to
Broadway and learn his trade.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brainard was thankful that Louisiana was safe on the high seas
on her way to Munich, and would not see this article!</p>
<p>Somewhere Farson ran across a statuesque young woman of German
extraction who spoke English as if she had a cracker in her
mouth, and became persuaded that the mission of their
organization was to introduce to the American public the new
plays of the advanced European theater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must become the theater of ideas,&rdquo; he said to
Brainard.</p>
<p>So, with the assistance of Miss Beatrice Klinker in leading
roles, the People&rsquo;s Theater became frankly
&ldquo;highbrow&rdquo; and went after Brieux, Hauptmann,
Strindberg, and the tribe of the peculiar.&nbsp; Brainard poured
out money like water in buying rights at exorbitant prices, in
preparing new scenery, and in expensive additions to the <a
name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
297</span>company.&nbsp; He foresaw that at this rate, instead of
starting a chain of popular theaters across the continent, he
would have all he could do to maintain one organization in New
York, with possibly a couple of road companies.&nbsp; For the
receipts were always negligible.&nbsp; To such comparatively
modest limits had his great Idea already shrunken.&nbsp; If he
had not thus far succeeded in enlightening any large section of
the American Public in dramatic art, he himself had received a
very thorough and costly lesson, not merely in the drama, but in
human nature and life.&nbsp; That, however, had not been his
purpose!</p>
<p>It was not until the People&rsquo;s Theater produced an erotic
piece by a new Danish writer, whose name was unknown to the
critics, that the house began to fill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve struck our pace!&rdquo; Farson declared
jubilantly.&nbsp; He exercised all his journalistic ingenuity in
whetting the appetite of the New York public for the play with
immediate results in the box office.&nbsp; Brainard, although he
had no high opinion of the play, felt relieved not to encounter
at each performance the same dreary waste of empty seats.&nbsp;
He comforted himself with the thought that if the Public could be
induced to come to a &ldquo;sex play,&rdquo; they might be
captured for less hectic entertainments.&nbsp; MacNaughton and <a
name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 298</span>Farson,
with the easy sophistry of the theater, maintained that what
people cared to see must be good art and stoutly defended the
Danish piece.</p>
<p>But their good luck did not hold.&nbsp; At the Saturday
matin&eacute;e of the first week the police visited the theater
and the curtain was ordered down after the bedroom scene in the
second act.&nbsp; There was a mild demonstration among the
audience, whose curiosity was defeated, and the price of their
tickets was repaid to all who demanded it.&nbsp; The press made
considerable noise over the event.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re made!&rdquo; MacNaughton announced in great
excitement.&nbsp; Farson was busy with the reporters, trying to
get the most out of this unexpected bit of publicity.&nbsp;
Brainard set forth in search of the virtuous police commissioner
to protest in the name of outraged Art.&nbsp; But the
commissioner was impervious to Art.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sort of show don&rsquo;t go in New York,&rdquo; he
pronounced austerely, in reply to Brainard&rsquo;s argument that
the play had been given even more boldly in Vienna and Berlin and
was held to be a &ldquo;moral document&rdquo; by the best
European critics.&nbsp; The police commissioner seemed to think
that New York had a different and better morality than that
obtaining in Europe.&nbsp; He was obdurate.&nbsp; When Brainard
reported his failure to his associates, Farson took it very
lightly.</p>
<p><a name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
299</span>&ldquo;All we&rsquo;ll have to do,&rdquo; he suggested,
&ldquo;is to make some slight changes&mdash;put a screen in front
of the bed scene&mdash;and see the inspector.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
take care of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Brainard refused to pay the police to be allowed to
produce his play, and so on Monday night the People&rsquo;s
Theater remained dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And just look at all that money!&rdquo; MacNaughton
wailed, as something of a crowd began to form in front of the
theater for the first time.&nbsp; &ldquo;The governor is a
miserable puritan,&rdquo; he said to Farson, wringing his
hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;To think of turning his back on his luck just
because of the morality of the New York police!&nbsp; He ought to
run a Sunday school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard was not to be moved, although the theater would have
to remain closed for a week until the company could prepare
another play.&nbsp; He was deeply disgusted with the whole
affair, with the notoriety as well as the cheap pretense of
morality by the police commissioner.&nbsp; For the first time in
four years his faith in the great Idea began to waver, and he
longed to escape from New York to the more vital air of
Arizona.&nbsp; There had been some difficulty recently with the
pumps at the Melody mine, and he might well take this opportunity
of running down to Monument.&nbsp; Once there it would be a
temptation to abandon <a name="page300"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 300</span>the great Idea altogether and to
remain in the mountains developing the copper mine.&nbsp; Or he
could buy a coffee plantation in Jalapa, as he had once
fleetingly thought of doing, and settle himself in Mexico like a
medieval prince.&nbsp; Possibly the little se&ntilde;orita Marie
had not yet found another Prince and had waited all these years
for his expected return.&nbsp; The vision of that beautiful
semitropical valley dominated by the snowy crown of the old
volcano returned to his memory with alluring colors.&nbsp; Life
in such a far-off Eden with a gentle creature as mistress of a
rose-covered ha&ccedil;ienda was an inviting contrast to the
glare and vulgarity of New York. . . .</p>
<p>Brainard and the secretary left the theater in glum silence,
each possessed by an unhappy train of thought.&nbsp; On their way
uptown they passed a billboard on which some flaming posters
displayed certain tempting scenes from a soul-and-body-stirring
play called <i>The Stolen Bonds</i>, now being given for the
first time in New York.&nbsp; Brainard paused before the gaudy
billboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the public really likes!&rdquo; Farson commented
with a grin.</p>
<p>Brainard remembered Louisiana&rsquo;s angry
taunt,&mdash;&ldquo;Go and see a good melodrama&mdash;see what
folks are willing to pay real money for!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take it in!&rdquo; he exclaimed, seizing
his <a name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
301</span>companion&rsquo;s arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t
anything else to do this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get all the goods before we reach the
show,&rdquo; the secretary observed, pointing to another series
of immense posters that represented a gloomy bank vault in which
a masked gentleman was holding a lantern above the prostrate form
of a woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not afraid of giving away
their story!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we shall find the great American play we have
been hunting for all this year,&rdquo; Brainard replied, as they
came into the garish foyer of the theater.&nbsp; At one side was
the entrance to a brilliant saloon, which seemed part of the
establishment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Democratic and convivial this,&rdquo;
he joked, thinking of the dainty &ldquo;tea room&rdquo; at the
People&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>There were only box seats left.&nbsp; When the two pushed
aside the plush curtains that concealed these luxurious retreats,
the curtain was up and the first act had started before a house
packed with prosperous-looking citizens and their women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a dead seat in the house, I&rsquo;ll bet!&rdquo;
whispered the secretary.</p>
<p>The scene represented the inside of an office, with a large
safe at one side.&nbsp; The short, black-haired heroine was
striving ineffectually to bar the way of a brawny villain, who
had her covered with a <a name="page302"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 302</span>revolver in one hand, and with the
other whipped an ether cone from an inner pocket.&nbsp; She was
rapidly crowded into the vault, where she succumbed in due time,
after a muscular struggle and curdling shrieks, to the ether
cone.&nbsp; Thereupon the burglar set busily to work to fill an
enormous sample case with piles of yellow currency and bundles
conveniently labeled <span class="smcap">Bonds</span>, in large
letters, so that a child might read.&nbsp; The villain then
departed, carefully locking the door of the safe upon the
etherized heroine.</p>
<p>But the villain had reckoned without the telephone.&nbsp; In
the next scene the stenographer-heroine slowly grabbed the ether
cone from her face, gaspingly crawled to the corner, where the
telephone hung conspicuously, and called Central.&nbsp; Presently
the bolts began to grumble, and were shot back by a young man who
rushed in and dragged the tottering woman from the safe, while
she murmured in a dying whisper audible for two blocks:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ferry, Jasper!&nbsp; The ferry!&nbsp; The
thief!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the noble girl fell swooning and
apparently lifeless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something doing!&rdquo; Farson remarked
with an appreciative grin, and added with a peculiar expression,
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve taken more than a hint from my one
play.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
303</span>&ldquo;And several more from life,&rdquo; Brainard
muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it <i>is</i> life through the medium of my
play&mdash;but altered somehow,&rdquo; Farson observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! much altered!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next scene was labeled, &ldquo;<span class="smcap">At the
Ferry Slip</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">San
Francisco</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; As the curtain rose, the
villain&mdash;no longer masked, but with a long ulster concealing
all but his sinister eyes&mdash;was deftly transferring himself
and his sample case, stuffed with money and bonds, on board the
ferry-boat.&nbsp; The bell rang&mdash;business in the
wings.&nbsp; Then on rushed the hero-lover, clutching vainly at
the disappearing sample case.&nbsp; There was a desperate tussle
between the hero and the villain, while the dummy passengers on
the deck above obligingly turned their backs.&nbsp; The villain
cut loose from his pursuer with a wicked knife, threw the case
upon the moving boat, and leaped two yards after it, leaving the
prostrate figure of the hero-lover half dropping over the
slip.&nbsp; The stenographer-heroine appeared&mdash;in a neat
traveling suit&mdash;and pulled her lover safely ashore.&nbsp;
Curtain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; Farson shouted enthusiastically.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t exactly life, it&rsquo;s the way
we&rsquo;d all like to have it happen, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be nearer life than you think,&rdquo; <a
name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 304</span>Brainard
assented with a queer smile.&nbsp; In this scene he had been able
to get a good view of the heroine of the piece.&nbsp; Beneath the
coarse make-up he thought he recognized familiar features, and
felt sure that he had heard in real life that pert, nasal voice
which had just uttered the last
speech&mdash;&ldquo;Escaped!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll track him into the
darkest wilds of Africa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Recognize a friend?&rdquo; Farson inquired.&nbsp;
Brainard nodded.&nbsp; They turned over the leaves of their
program to find the name of the heroine.&nbsp; It was Lorilla
Walters, in large black type.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lorilla,&rdquo; Farson murmured.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good
stage name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds like her!&rdquo; Brainard agreed.</p>
<p>Just then the curtain went up for the third act.&nbsp; Here
was a rapid succession of scenes representing the pursuit and
escape of the villain in the Arizona desert, with one very lurid
background of flaming mountains and sagebrush plain.&nbsp; Pistol
shots and a chase through an adobe ha&ccedil;ienda outside a
Mexican village concluded the act.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew, these people have wire nerves!&rdquo; Farson
commented, wiping his brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have treated the story rather freely,&rdquo;
Brainard remarked grimly.&nbsp; Farson talked nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Louisiana would like that!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s <a name="page305"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 305</span>something doing all the time.&nbsp;
I bet that&rsquo;s Lorilla.&nbsp; What do you say to trying her
at the People&rsquo;s?&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a trifle broad in her
methods, but sound&mdash;and lets herself go all the time.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s just a bit loud in tone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not louder than life sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It carries home&mdash;look at the audience!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the fourth act the villain was at last cornered by the
stenographer-heroine and the hero-lover, aided by a United States
cruiser, which intercepted the villain and his sample case as
they were about to sail away from the port of Vera Cruz on a
Spanish steamer.&nbsp; The captain of the steamer on which the
villain had taken refuge with his sample case blasphemously
defied the flag of the United States with loud curses.&nbsp; But
a booming shot from the wings knocked his smokestack out of
service, and brought him to his senses.&nbsp; The captain
thereafter gracefully received the smart American lieutenant who
came aboard in holiday uniform and collared the villain,
denounced by the heroine, as he cowered behind the fallen
smokestack&mdash;still wearing the long ulster.</p>
<p>They applauded vigorously and were about to drift out with the
crowd of candy-eating females and their escorts, when the
curtains of the box were parted by a gentleman in evening
clothes, who stood smiling, holding his spotless silk hat <a
name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 306</span>in one hand
and extending the other to Brainard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; the stranger said easily, as if he were
greeting a casual acquaintance whom he had not seen for several
days.&nbsp; He came forward into the box, and sat on the edge of
a chair, dangling his glossy silk hat.&nbsp; &ldquo;Saw you from
behind,&rdquo; he added, smiling slightly upon Brainard, whose
surprise was evident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, Hollinger!&rdquo; the latter exclaimed, recovering
himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, in the show business,&mdash;same as you,&rdquo; he
added with a little laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last time I saw you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was in that Jalapa hotel where I had the pleasure of
delivering a little lecture on life for your benefit,&rdquo; the
fight-trust man supplied.&nbsp; &ldquo;You profited by it at
once&mdash;that very night, if I remember rightly.&nbsp; Rarely
does a teacher of morals get such a rapid reaction!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Brainard laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Necessity
pointed the moral to your talk with a kick.&nbsp; I left on a
mule car, and got away just in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Calloway told me the next morning.&nbsp; We tried to
keep your friends interested in Jalapa until the boat
sailed.&nbsp; I take it that we succeeded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I owe you a great deal for that good
turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it,&rdquo; Hollinger murmured, <a
name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 307</span>slipping
into the chair, &ldquo;always ready to serve a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard introduced Farson, who knew the &ldquo;king of the
prize ring trust&rdquo; by sight, for Hollinger had been a
celebrated figure on the Coast in the days before the graft
trials.&nbsp; The three chatted for a time while the auditorium
emptied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you like our play?&rdquo; he inquired
casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your play!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s suspiciously like
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we drew from the same sources.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get into the theatrical business?&rdquo;
Brainard inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got into it in a rather roundabout way,&rdquo; the
fight-trust magnate explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;You remember the
event at Jalapa?&nbsp; The American papers were full of it at the
time.&nbsp; I was interested in the moving picture concession for
the States.&nbsp; We expected to make big money out of it.&nbsp;
But they had another spasm of virtue in this country about that
time, and we were shut out of the best circuits.&nbsp; So from
the movies I got into vaudeville and then into the regular show
business.&nbsp; Have a couple of circuits on the Coast and
interests in the East also.&nbsp; This is one of my
companies.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve done a tremendous business out
West in this thing&mdash;did it appeal to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled genially at Brainard, and added: <a
name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span>&ldquo;We
couldn&rsquo;t work in the ha&ccedil;ienda scene,&mdash;roses,
moonlight, Orizaba, pretty Mexican girl, and the rest,&mdash;it
took too much scenery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought it was a trifle overdrawn,&rdquo; Brainard
observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the theater demands that, you
know,&mdash;exaggeration.&nbsp; Art is never quite like
nature.&nbsp; Even Milton threw it on thick at times, if I
recollect. . . .&nbsp; But it stirs the blood&mdash;that&rsquo;s
what you want in these dull times.&nbsp; People come to the
theater to feel, their lives are so dull.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the
first thing I learned in the show business.&nbsp; Give the public
something to tease the nerves, keep &rsquo;em on the jump.&nbsp;
And the second thing I learned was that you must always hold up a
high moral standard.&nbsp; It never pays in the long run to cater
to the small class that can afford to think about morals as
freely as they act.&rdquo;&nbsp; He looked at Brainard
meaningly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I saw your show last week,&rdquo; he
explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not really tough, but it
don&rsquo;t pay to do that sort of thing.&nbsp; Most people, of
course, are not half as good as they like to think they
are.&nbsp; But even the worst want their art and literature
better than they know they are and better than they think their
neighbors are.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the way they square themselves
with life,&rdquo; he concluded sententiously.</p>
<p>This was the second time, Brainard reflected, <a
name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 309</span>that he had
received a valuable lesson in ethics from the fight-trust
magnate.&nbsp; He understood now why Hollinger had been reading
Milton when he first made his acquaintance on the Overland
Limited.&nbsp; He was a business philosopher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are going to deal with people,&rdquo; he added
gently, &ldquo;you must know how they act and feel about
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that is why you let the heroine capture the
thief in this piece?&rdquo; Brainard remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely!&nbsp; The clever young dramatist who knocked
the thing together for me was all for another ending, a more
convincing one, perhaps, where the heroine was bought off for a
good share of the bonds and currency.&nbsp; But although
admitting the truth of his reasoning, I could not permit him to
ruin the success of our play.&nbsp; We were compelled to violate
nature again, and in deference to the public&rsquo;s unquenchable
thirst for Virtue we allowed the slow-moving heroine to
accomplish the dire purpose of her vengeful passions with the
assistance of the government.&nbsp; In its present form our play
is terribly satisfying to our public.&nbsp; It gratifies
especially that common human desire to get somebody.&nbsp; Half
our criminal justice is built upon the same unpleasant trait of
human nature. . . .&nbsp; By the way,&rdquo; he remarked,
interrupting the flow of his philosophical analysis, &ldquo;I
almost forgot!&nbsp; <a name="page310"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 310</span>There&rsquo;s a friend of yours in
behind who wants to see you.&nbsp; I promised to bring you
back.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve no objections?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None at all!&rdquo; Brainard laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
see our encounter didn&rsquo;t turn out quite like the play,
fortunately for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I understand,&rdquo; Hollinger replied demurely,
holding the curtain aside to let the others precede him.</p>
<h3><a name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
311</span>X</h3>
<p>They found the leading lady waiting for them on the darkened
stage.&nbsp; She was dressed quite handsomely in her street
costume, with the inevitable fur coat that seems the most
characteristic mark of her profession.&nbsp; Without her makeup
and stage costume she looked much older than Brainard remembered
her to be and also stouter.&nbsp; But her dark face and flashing
eyes still preserved an air of confident assurance in her good
looks that had characterized Krutzmacht&rsquo;s stenographer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Mr. Wilkins!&rdquo; she said promptly as
the men approached her.&nbsp; At that unfortunate <i>nom de
guerre</i> Farson laughed outright.&nbsp; Hollinger came to the
rescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Edgar Brainard, of the new People&rsquo;s Theater;
Miss Lorilla Walters of <i>The Stolen Bonds</i> company,&rdquo;
the fight-trust man said with a little cough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We seem both to have changed names,&rdquo; Brainard
observed, shaking hands with the leading lady.</p>
<p><a name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
312</span>&ldquo;Walters is my stage name,&rdquo; the former
stenographer snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wilkins was mine&mdash;for a few hours!&rdquo; Brainard
laughed.</p>
<p>There followed an awkward pause.&nbsp; In spite of the amiable
greeting, Brainard could see fire in the woman&rsquo;s dark eyes
and realized that it was not simply for the pleasure of meeting
her former antagonist again that she had got Hollinger to bring
him behind the scenes.&nbsp; He realized also from the determined
bearing and solid form of the woman he had once unceremoniously
locked up in Krutzmacht&rsquo;s safe for an hour, that she
possessed a kind of vindictive energy which might easily become
troublesome to any man she disliked.&nbsp; For a brief moment he
wished that a wayward fate had not led his steps on this evening
into the Boulevard Theater.&nbsp; But it was so patently absurd
that the woman could in any way touch him now after all these
years that he easily put aside the thought.&nbsp; He had led his
new life so long, tested himself with men and affairs so
thoroughly that his early adventures in Krutzmacht&rsquo;s
service seemed to him more like a youthful escapade than
reality.</p>
<p>During this mute encounter Farson and Hollinger watched the
two with interest.&nbsp; Hollinger leaned against one of the
properties of the last act in <i>The Stolen Bonds</i>, a slightly
satirical <a name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
313</span>smile on his lips as if he found much intellectual
amusement in the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pretty lively show you have made out of
our little affair,&rdquo; Brainard remarked at last to the
leading lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve touched up the story all
along and the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> isn&rsquo;t according to
the facts as I remember them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Walters gave a little twitch to her short veil as she
snapped meaningly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it isn&rsquo;t finished yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As our friend Hollinger has been proving to me,&rdquo;
Brainard continued in his scoffing tone, &ldquo;Art and Nature
don&rsquo;t always jibe.&nbsp; The artist has always found fault
with dull fact, and he gets his revenge upon the real world as
you took yours to-night in the play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One gets it somehow,&rdquo; Miss Walters replied
enigmatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are going to discuss Art and Nature,&rdquo;
Hollinger put in genially, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go to some place
where we can have supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good idea,&rdquo; Brainard agreed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come
home with me.&nbsp; My man usually has something ready for me at
this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He felt that something more vital than a discussion of Art and
Nature was impending and thought that his own house would be a
better place for an animated interview than a public <a
name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
314</span>caf&eacute;.&nbsp; So the four picked their way in the
gloom among the bulky properties of <i>The Stolen Bonds</i> to
the stage exit and there found a cab, which carried them quickly
to the little house in Gramercy Park.&nbsp; Miss Walters did not
open her mouth during the ride; Hollinger and Farson maintained a
factitious conversation on politics, and the contrasts between
San Francisco and New York.&nbsp; The fight-trust man ridiculed
&ldquo;progressivism,&rdquo; which was just then coming into
vogue, shrewdly pointing out that it merely cloaked the
aspirations of &ldquo;the little fellows&rdquo; to &ldquo;get big
Capital,&rdquo; and praised California as the only place for an
American to live in.&nbsp; From time to time Brainard eyed the
actress from his corner of the cab, wondering what her relations
with his versatile acquaintance might be.&nbsp; She did not seem
interested in the conversation and stared steadily into the
street.</p>
<p>There were bottles and cold meats on the table in the dining
room as Brainard had promised.&nbsp; Farson discovered in the
pantry the ingredients for a hot dish, and Hollinger showed
himself to be an expert in this sort of an impromptu feast.&nbsp;
The three men were soon busy with chafing dish and corkscrew in a
comradely way, but Miss Walters, refusing to lay aside her long
fur coat and hat, sauntered about the cheerful room, <a
name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 315</span>examining
carefully the pictures and prints upon the walls, the furniture
and appointments, which though not especially luxurious were
thoroughly comfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this your house?&rdquo; she asked her host point
blank, and when he nodded she remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty cozy sort of place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is comfortable,&rdquo; Brainard agreed, &ldquo;and
very convenient.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t stand hotels,&rdquo; he
added by way of excuse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of us have to stand &rsquo;em and be mighty
thankful when they&rsquo;re fit to live in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not having any appropriate reply to this remark, Brainard
urged the actress to lay aside her wraps and sit down before the
fire, which he had stirred into a blaze.&nbsp; She grudgingly
unbuttoned her coat and sat on the edge of the large chair he
pushed to the hearth, stretching forth her worn shoes to the
warmth, and hitching up her skirt in a slightly vulgar
manner.</p>
<p>When Hollinger announced that his dish was ready, the four
drew up at the table and had supper, which, thanks to Farson and
the fight-trust man, was lively enough.&nbsp; They discussed
theatrical matters, especially the Danish play on which the
People&rsquo;s had come to grief.&nbsp; Hollinger maintained that
the trouble with the play was that it was neither moral nor
immoral enough.&nbsp; It was <a name="page316"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 316</span>simply too much like life.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If you are going in for vice, you must paint it
red,&rdquo; he pronounced.&nbsp; The leading lady listened and
taciturnly ate her supper.&nbsp; Afterwards she accepted a
cigarette and turned again to the fire.&nbsp; Brainard searched
his brain for a topic that might interest her and finally
asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have you been on the stage, Miss
Walters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a good many years ago, the first show I was
in,&rdquo; she replied, and added with
intention,&mdash;&ldquo;before I met Krutzmacht.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was that?&rdquo; he asked lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Los Angeles in ninety-two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You gave up the stage for a time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said slowly.&nbsp; &ldquo;He wanted me
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Supper being finished, Brainard led the way to the large
living room on the floor above.&nbsp; Here there were books,
pictures, and old theatrical bills that seemed to interest
Hollinger.&nbsp; He and Farson remained at one end of the room
and thus gave Brainard a further opportunity for conversation
with Miss Walters.&nbsp; Somewhat softened by the good supper and
the friendly reception, she began to talk more freely of herself,
her early experiences on the stage in a small stock company that
played in the little towns of central and <a
name="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 317</span>southern
California, until she met Herbert Krutzmacht, who happened to be
in Los Angeles one night when she was playing.&nbsp; Brainard,
who was curious to find out all he could about Krutzmacht,
observed carelessly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were working in his office when I&mdash;when we
last met?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I was working for him,&rdquo; she said
shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why,&rdquo; he asked suddenly, &ldquo;did you try
to sell him out to his enemies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had good reasons,&rdquo; she replied, looking him
defiantly in the face, &ldquo;a woman&rsquo;s reasons.&nbsp; He
hadn&rsquo;t played fair with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is, hadn&rsquo;t married you as you hoped he
would?&rdquo; Brainard suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo; she flashed quickly,
realizing that she was in danger of committing herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope the railroad people paid you well for your
services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They quit paying me, naturally, after you got over to
Europe with the stuff they wanted and sold it to the
Germans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They dealt with the Germans instead,&rdquo; Brainard
laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;It might have paid better to stick by the
old man to the end? . . .&nbsp; So, after we parted at Vera Cruz,
you went back to the stage&mdash;into the legitimate?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
318</span>&ldquo;Mr. Hollinger suggested it when I met him at
Jalapa.&nbsp; He got me a place in one of the San Francisco
theaters a friend of his was running, and then later on when he
went into the show business himself, he took me for one of his
companies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like the work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as good as anything else,&rdquo; the leading
lady replied, &ldquo;so long as you&rsquo;ve got to work for your
living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of us have to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless we are clever enough to get somebody else to do
the work for us,&rdquo; she sneered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I think we lose most of the fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Walters stared at him skeptically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of your taking that lofty tone
with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard laughed good-naturedly.&nbsp; He found in this case,
as he had in so many others, that a little personal contact with
an enemy modifies and humanizes any antagonism.&nbsp; &ldquo;Eat
with an enemy and lose your hate,&rdquo; is an old proverb, the
truth of which he was proving.&nbsp; In spite of the hardness and
vulgarity of Miss Lorilla Walters, actress and stenographer,
there was something pathetic in her commonplace struggle with
life, which he felt through her brief admissions.&nbsp; She had
been fighting all her life for herself with <a
name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 319</span>somewhat
coarse weapons, the only ones she knew how to use, and her
appearance, now that she had lost the advantage of youth and was
declining towards middle age, her cheap clothes, her defiant
manner,&mdash;all told of the losing game.&nbsp; He was already
beginning to wonder what he could do for Krutzmacht&rsquo;s old
stenographer, wondering whether by any chance she could be fitted
into the People&rsquo;s company, when his amiable meditations
were disagreeably interrupted by the actress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use your playing the great philanthropist
with me,&rdquo; she said truculently.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know what
you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A crook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I happen to know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble always has been from the moment I entered
Krutzmacht&rsquo;s office that afternoon that you have persisted
in this wrong idea.&nbsp; You took me for a common thief then,
and you think me a successful swindler now.&nbsp; Well, it
happens that I am neither.&nbsp; So you can&rsquo;t
understand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked over the comfortable room, which for the moment
they had to themselves, as Farson had taken Hollinger into the
library.</p>
<p><a name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
320</span>&ldquo;You seem to have done very well by
yourself,&rdquo; she observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was Krutzmacht&rsquo;s legitimate agent then, when I
entered his office, and I have been his executor so to speak
every since,&rdquo;&mdash;and as she shrugged her shoulders
skeptically, he added, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a cent of my
own&mdash;really not a cent; I am poorer than you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want me to believe that song? . . .&nbsp; How about
the theater and the mine in Arizona?&nbsp; You see I have been
following you up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They belong to somebody else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed&mdash;to whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t tell you that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you can&rsquo;t. . . .&nbsp; They belong to
<i>me</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prove your claim then!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will hand them over on a platter with a fine
bow? . . .&nbsp; You <i>are</i> smooth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked into Brainard&rsquo;s smiling face with an
expression of perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But until you can prove your claim, beyond doubt, I
shall continue in possession both of the mine and of the theater
as guardian of the property.&nbsp; And I shall fight you with all
the resources I have until I am convinced that your claim is
sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The actress slowly walked to the fire and threw away the
cigarette she had been smoking.</p>
<p><a name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
321</span>&ldquo;Well, I guess we understand each other,&rdquo;
she said in a less truculent voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a curious sort of idiot,&rdquo; she remarked
musingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why we should
fight.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s enough money for two from what the
papers say about that mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a great deal more than enough for
two,&rdquo; Brainard laughed, &ldquo;in one sense, but only
enough for one in another&mdash;the right one,&rdquo; he added
meaningly.</p>
<p>The actress watched him closely as he crossed the room to
straighten a picture that hung awry on the wall.&nbsp; She swayed
gently to and fro in the vulgar pose of the heroine of <i>The
Stolen Bonds</i>, looking into the fire.&nbsp; When she glanced
up she saw that Brainard was observing her, a slight smile on his
lips.&nbsp; He was thinking that she had the temperament that
might have made a good actress, but had been hopelessly spoiled
by her bringing up and environment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you ready with
the proof?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a queer sort of Willy,&rdquo; she
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you and me can ever
rightly understand each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I understand <i>you</i>,&rdquo; Brainard
laughed; &ldquo;you want Krutzmacht&rsquo;s money&mdash;that is
quite <a name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
322</span>intelligible!&nbsp; And you may not think so, but I am
sorry for you&mdash;I would really like to help you out&mdash;get
a better position for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t divide!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never&mdash;all or nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know where I&rsquo;m going to-night when I leave
your swell little house?&nbsp; Over on Second Avenue into a
third-class hotel where my mother and I get along with one
bedroom between us.&nbsp; Hollinger don&rsquo;t pay any big
salaries!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Krutzmacht treated me like most men treat women
they&rsquo;ve got cheap.&nbsp; I had no reason to be loyal to
him, as I told you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless,&rdquo; Brainard suggested lightly, &ldquo;you
happened to be his wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Walters ignored the implication and continued
explanatorily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we lost you at Vera Cruz, and the railroad men I
was working for had no more use for me, I was down and out.&nbsp;
There didn&rsquo;t seem to be anything for anybody from
Krutzmacht&rsquo;s money except what the Germans got and
you!&nbsp; So I went into the show that I told you of.&nbsp; But
it seems there was a good deal more property I didn&rsquo;t know
about&mdash;he was always close mouthed.&nbsp; You were clever
enough to find that mine and keep it for yourself. . . .&nbsp; It
wasn&rsquo;t <a name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
323</span>until you struck New York that anybody heard about
it.&nbsp; Then the papers and the magazines were full of it and
of you and of all the money you were throwing away on a
theater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Publicity is one of the penalties of success,&rdquo;
Brainard observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It helped me to find you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard bowed in acknowledgment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want any more trouble?&rdquo; she
suggested in a gentler tone than she had previously used.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind trouble,&rdquo; Brainard retorted
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I was content with a half million&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not make it two?&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
324</span>XI</h3>
<p>At this point Hollinger and Farson returned to the room.&nbsp;
Hollinger looked quickly at the position of the two, smiled
placidly, and helped himself to another cigar from the box on the
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exchanging confidences?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Walters persists in acting all the time,&rdquo;
Brainard replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;She thinks this is a sequel to the
play and wants me to hand over to her a lot of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; Hollinger observed sententiously,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s the easiest way to square things, isn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard looked at the fight-trust man in astonishment.&nbsp;
Was he an accomplice in a vulgar blackmail game?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not <i>my</i> way,&rdquo; he said
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half a loaf when no part of the loaf is really yours is
always more enjoyable than a legal scrimmage over the whole loaf,
it seems to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hollinger threw himself into an easy-chair, lighted his cigar
carefully, and beamed at Brainard.</p>
<p><a name="page325"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
325</span>&ldquo;Did it ever occur to you, my young
friend,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;that we four are, so to speak,
all in the same boat?&nbsp; We are all adventurers&mdash;of that
noble company of gentlemen and lady adventurers in life&mdash;to
paraphrase the quaint motto of the Hudson Bay Company.&nbsp; Now
in the course of the complicated tissue of adventure that happens
to have brought us three together from very unlike walks in life,
you&rdquo;&mdash;he thrust the glowing point of his cigar towards
Brainard,&mdash;&ldquo;have proved to be the Star.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re It!&nbsp; You hold the bag, so to speak.&nbsp; You
seem to have shared some of its golden contents with our young
friend here who wants to write plays, as he tells me.&nbsp; I do
not happen to want anything for myself.&nbsp; I am perfectly
disinterested in this case,&mdash;fortunately can afford to
be.&nbsp; For I have other and sufficiently fat fish frying in my
own little pan.&nbsp; So I can play the gracious r&ocirc;le of
Wisdom. . . .&nbsp; Why not be generous to the lady who lost in
this matter of the old Dutchman&rsquo;s millions&mdash;you can
afford it&mdash;and nothing becomes a young unmarried Idealist
more than princely generosity with other people&rsquo;s
dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; Brainard began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me&mdash;one moment&mdash;to finish clearing the
ground.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know the precise manner in which you
came into possession of Herbert <a name="page326"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 326</span>Krutzmacht&rsquo;s money any more
than I know exactly how he got it away from those who wanted
it.&nbsp; I presume the methods were not essentially
unlike.&nbsp; It never interests me, these details of
acquisition,&mdash;to know just how our plutocratic masters have
raked together their pelf.&nbsp; But the method of distribution
does interest me tremendously.&nbsp; The rich usually show such
little capacity for imagination or daring in the disposal of
their wealth!&nbsp; However, that is another theme. . . .&nbsp;
Now this lady, whose slender talent as an actress I have had the
honor of supporting, thinks she has some cogent claim to the
unearned increment of the deceased Dutchman.&nbsp; Her idea is
probably fantastic&mdash;most of our ideas about
&lsquo;rights&rsquo; are&mdash;but it is a fixed idea with
her!&rdquo;&nbsp; He leaned forward and waved his cigar
rhythmically to drive home his words.&nbsp; &ldquo;Unless her
idea is adequately gratified, I am afraid she will be unhappy and
make you considerable trouble in the course of her effort to
satisfy her quite unreasonable desire.&nbsp; <i>Voil&agrave;
tout</i>, as the French say.&nbsp; Or if you prefer English,
Better pay and forget, rather than save a few dollars and regret,
my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a good anarchist,&rdquo; Farson observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for the explanation.&nbsp; I know that I am a
practical man.&nbsp; If our rich, our very rich citizens, would
only recognize more frankly the <a name="page327"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 327</span>truth I have been stating, they
would be happier and so would we others.&nbsp; But they are very
timid and conservative; they rarely get beyond libraries,
museums, and hospitals.&nbsp; All dull and comparatively useless
affairs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fight-trust man sank back into his chair and smoked with
half-closed eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your talk is interesting, Hollinger, as always,&rdquo;
Brainard remarked, &ldquo;but unfortunately this time I
can&rsquo;t follow your advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it happens not to be my own money that Miss
Walters desires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hollinger waved one hand deprecatingly and murmured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mere matter of words that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I mean it!&nbsp; As I have been explaining to Miss
Walters, I am really a poor man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poverty is a relative matter&mdash;science has
demonstrated that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything of Krutzmacht&rsquo;s I hold as
trustee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like Carnegie, or was it the Emperor William? .
. .&nbsp; Pardon me, that is another formula.&nbsp; We are all
trustees, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard paused and then resumed in a different tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been over this matter with Miss Walters and
explained my position.&nbsp; I think she <a
name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 328</span>understands
it quite well.&nbsp; If she can produce proof that she was
legally married to the late Herbert Krutzmacht&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would not be as crude as that!&rdquo; Hollinger
exclaimed, opening his eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know as well as the
next man how purely accidental marriage is&mdash;the ceremony I
mean.&nbsp; The law fastens on that of course&mdash;it has to
have some nail to cling to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I told Miss Walters, the trouble with her, and I am
afraid with you, too, Hollinger, is that you can&rsquo;t
comprehend an honest man.&nbsp; I happen to be a mere honest
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, don&rsquo;t believe I doubted it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just plain, old-fashioned, vulgar honest,&rdquo;
Brainard continued irascibly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Neither of you seem to
understand that simple fact.&nbsp; You proceed on two false
assumptions,&mdash;first that I am a crook and second that I am a
coward&mdash;I might add a third, that I am a fool.&nbsp; So long
as these false assumptions remain embedded in your mind, we
simply can&rsquo;t do business together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked suggestively towards the door.&nbsp; Hollinger also
rose, a little wearily, a bored look on his face, and chucked his
cigar into the fireplace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;that we have
<a name="page329"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
329</span>succeeded in straining your sense of humor. . . .&nbsp;
The trouble with you virtuous people is that you bristle so
easily at the least touch.&nbsp; I should think that Virtue would
be more self-satisfying to its practitioners.&nbsp; Now I
don&rsquo;t bristle because you assume that I am a petty
blackmailer and am trying to get money for Miss Walters in order
to share with her.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what you
think&mdash;confess it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks that way,&rdquo; Brainard said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it does, it doesn&rsquo;t worry me in the
least.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t waste our time trying to prove to you
that I am Honest and Disinterested, that I came here to-night
really out of friendly interest in you&mdash;to try with the aid
of my equable temperament and clear intelligence to avoid the
mistakes that are likely to occur when excessive desire meets
excessive virtue.&nbsp; But I have failed.&nbsp; You two will
have to make up your accounts alone&mdash;or with the vulgar
assistance of the courts.&nbsp; Good luck to you.&nbsp; And good
night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He extended one hand to Brainard and the other to Farson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give myself the pleasure of setting you down at
your hotel,&rdquo; he said to the actress, who was slowly and
somewhat regretfully buttoning her fur coat.</p>
<p>When Farson and the actress had left the room, <a
name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 330</span>Brainard
detained Hollinger and said contritely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I did suspect you of collusion with
Miss Walters&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry, for I have always liked
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very natural.&nbsp; You yourself must know
how hard it is in this world to be really disinterested without
incurring unjust suspicions.&nbsp; However, that&rsquo;s
nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble is I can&rsquo;t understand you&mdash;never
did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t return the
compliment.&nbsp; I flatter myself that I understand you
thoroughly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember that first time I met you&mdash;on the
train, the Overland Limited, going to California?&nbsp; You were
in your compartment reading <i>Paradise Lost</i> with the help of
a dictionary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fight-trust man blushed slightly, probably at the mention
of the dictionary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the occasion when that active young seeker for
notoriety, the special district attorney of San Francisco, was
trying to put me in state&rsquo;s prison?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were under bonds then, seventy-five thousand
dollars of bonds.&nbsp; I remember how awed I was at the size of
your bonds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I recall the occasion now,&rdquo; the prize ring
magnate said with a pleasant smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;I <a
name="page331"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
331</span>didn&rsquo;t remember that was our first
meeting&mdash;I meet so many people everywhere&mdash;nor that I
happened to be making the acquaintance also of the famous puritan
poet. . . .&nbsp; The trouble with you, my friend, if you will
permit me to indulge in a last bit of advice, is that you are so
terribly conventional in your judgments of character, in your
expectations of what people are to be.&nbsp; That is a very
common limitation.&nbsp; You expected to find in me a bloody and
brutal bounder, smelling of whisky and dazzling with
diamonds.&nbsp; Instead you found an intelligent gentleman,
interested in literature and life.&nbsp; The prize ring, Mr.
Brainard, is as much an arena of Art in its way as the popular
theater to which you are devoting so much effort and such large
sums of money.&nbsp; And I was engaged in it as a business, as I
am now engaged in the theatrical business.&nbsp; A financier,
even of the prize ring, is not obliged to dirty himself with
vulgar contacts.&nbsp; That explains the lofty idealism of some
of our most prominent citizens.&nbsp; You plan and dream from
above&mdash;the degrading associations are left to others, as
doubtless you have already learned in the management of your own
properties. . . .&nbsp; Well, I must not keep Miss Walters
waiting below.&nbsp; Good night, my foolish Idealist!&nbsp; Good
luck and more wisdom to you before our next meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 332</span>They
descended to the hall which they found empty.&nbsp; Farson was
getting the actress a last cigarette.&nbsp; As they waited,
Hollinger observed musingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You doubtless know about the marriage laws in
California?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are extremely,&mdash;what shall I say?&nbsp;
Lax&mdash;liberal.&nbsp; You see our people out there are so
unconventional and accidental in their habit of life, that the
courts are forced to take the most liberal view of these personal
matters.&nbsp; And we are as a people chivalrous towards
women&mdash;much more so than you are here.&nbsp; So the courts
are inclined to decide the question of marriage largely on
whether the woman ought to have been married, rather than on the
mere fact of the ceremony.&nbsp; That accounts for the large
number of posthumous wives and their claims that turn up after
the death of a rich man on the Coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I to regard this as a threat?&rdquo; Brainard
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless you, my dear boy, don&rsquo;t be so
sensitive!&nbsp; Advice, just impertinent, uncalled-for advice,
which I am so fond of giving.&nbsp; I should have left all that
to Miss Lorilla&rsquo;s lawyers&mdash;they are the proper persons
to expound the California statutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
333</span>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe for one instant that
Miss Walters was really married to old Krutzmacht?&rdquo;
Hollinger shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Quien sabe</i>? as the Mexicans say.&nbsp; I have no
doubt she ought to have been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a very different matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hollinger again shrugged his shoulders.&nbsp; In the pause
that followed, Hollinger began to muse aloud softly, as if he
were presenting a case to himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her life has been typical.&nbsp; Born on a dreary
little ranch, educated for a few years in one of our national
institutions for the stultifying of youth, then deserted by her
worthless father and forced to do something for herself and her
useless mother,&mdash;what is the answer to that?&nbsp; Chorus
girl.&nbsp; Twelve dollars a week and mother to support as well
as herself and no special talent or exceptional looks,&mdash;what
is the answer to that?&nbsp; Man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom the girl in her gratitude tried to sell out when
he was in a tight place.&nbsp; No, I am afraid you can&rsquo;t
make out a very good case for charity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what had Krutzmacht done for her? . . .&nbsp;
Changed her job from a dubiously respectable one to an
undoubtedly disreputable one&mdash;and made her work in his
office besides.&nbsp; No, the balance is on her side of the
ledger. . . .&nbsp; Now <a name="page334"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 334</span>she has matured,&mdash;oh, very much
matured; has no protector, and mother still to support as well as
herself,&mdash;what is the answer to that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you put your claim on the ground of social service,
pure and simple,&rdquo; Brainard replied, &ldquo;it might be
considered, I suppose.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t think Miss Walters
would accept charity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charity&mdash;justice&mdash;prudence?&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s the use of finding the right name?&nbsp; In the last
analysis they are all meaningless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget they mean something to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She hungers for some of life&rsquo;s
goodies.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hollinger resumed his musing, ignoring
Brainard&rsquo;s reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;But comparatively little
would satisfy her&mdash;a secure home somewhere in southern
California for herself and that tough relic of a parent, a little
income, enough to assure permanent idleness.&nbsp; Consider what
a boon that would be to the stage in itself!&nbsp; Possibly
matrimony later on, why not? . . .&nbsp; As Krutzmacht&rsquo;s
residuary&mdash;er, trustee,&mdash;that&rsquo;s what you called
it, I believe, you ought to provide decently for his emotional
lapses. . . .&nbsp; I put it to you now as a Sentimentalist,
Idealist, Lover of Great Ideas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would talk me into giving her everything I
have,&rdquo; Brainard laughed, &ldquo;if I could only once bring
myself to accept your point of view.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page335"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
335</span>&ldquo;And that is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That life is merely a juggle of words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you are too young.&nbsp; One cannot fight
successfully against youth, even with ideas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Walters appeared, followed by Farson, and the
conversation was at an end.&nbsp; The actress looked at Brainard
from beneath her flaring hat, and her eyes had an unpleasant
luster in them.&nbsp; No, mere charity would not satisfy that
&ldquo;thirst for vengeance upon life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Wilkins,&rdquo; she began with a heavy effort
at irony, &ldquo;it is always sad for old friends to part.&nbsp;
But in this case we may hope to meet again before
long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so!&rdquo; Brainard replied politely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let me put you into the cab.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hollinger followed them slowly down the steps.&nbsp; At the
very door of the cab he lingered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that brief visit which you made to the Coast did you
ever come across a rattler in operation?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; It makes
a slight, but perfectly clear noise first by way of
warning&mdash;and then it strikes!&nbsp; Some women resemble the
rattler.&nbsp; Look out for the sting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks!&nbsp; I shall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; the prize ring magnate sighed in farewell,
&ldquo;my poor Idealist, what a lot of useless trouble you make
for yourself and others!&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
336</span>XII</h3>
<p>Brainard carefully put out all the lights on the lower floor
and then mounted the stairs to the room above.&nbsp; There he
found Farson smoking a cigarette before the open fire and staring
straight before him, as if his mind was occupied with a novel set
of ideas.&nbsp; At sight of Brainard a curious smile crossed his
face, and he looked interrogatively at his employer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are a pretty pair of&mdash;I was going to say
crooks.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t think my friend Hollinger is
exactly that&mdash;I hope not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He used to have the reputation of being the squarest
man in his profession&mdash;the very soul of honor in the fight
business.&nbsp; That was what gave him his prestige with the
politicians, until the district attorney got after
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make him out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not hard to make <i>her</i> out,&rdquo;
Farson commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her methods are only too obvious!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I ever tell you just what happened that <a
name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 337</span>evening in
San Francisco after I saw you off on the ferry with your
bag?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last I saw of you,&rdquo; Brainard replied,
&ldquo;you were on the run to the telephone booth to get your
beat about me and Krutzmacht to your paper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, after I &rsquo;phoned the story I streaked it
back to Krutzmacht&rsquo;s office.&nbsp; I fancied there might be
something doing there after the woman got loose from the
safe.&nbsp; There was!&nbsp; She had the marshal&rsquo;s office
and the police department&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know but the fire
brigade too&mdash;all up there buzzing, and she was trying to
raise Crane,&mdash;you know the big railroad gun on the other
side?&nbsp; She&rsquo;d kept that telephone working ever since
Peters threw the combination.&nbsp; If you had seen the temper
she was in, you might have left her in that safe somewhat longer
to cool off....&nbsp; She seems to have quieted down a good
deal.&nbsp; But I could see signs of her old temper this
evening.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe adversity has improved it
materially.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably not!&rdquo; Brainard remarked, yawning and
looking at his watch.&nbsp; &ldquo;Three o&rsquo;clock!&nbsp; Our
friends made the time pass quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farson did not move from his position before the dying
fire.&nbsp; The late hour made no impression upon him, and
Brainard did not seem anxious to get to bed.</p>
<p><a name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
338</span>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; the young man
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; Farson exclaimed in surprise.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will let Lorilla make the next move&mdash;it&rsquo;s
up to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t take Hollinger&rsquo;s hint?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buy her off?&nbsp; It would take too much, if we began
that game.&nbsp; Besides, why should I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man was evidently puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only thing she can do,&rdquo; Brainard explained,
&ldquo;is to produce a wife or heirs to Krutzmacht.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t believe she can do that successfully.&nbsp; If she
does, I am quite ready to resign without a fight.&nbsp;
But,&rdquo; he repeated musingly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe
she can prove that she was his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There would be harder things to prove,&rdquo; the
secretary ventured, &ldquo;especially in a California
court!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard smiled.&nbsp; He knew that Farson thought him a fool
to run the risk of a law suit and possibly failure in exposing
fraudulent claims to the property that he held on such slight
legal authority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I never told you the whole story,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You probably think, if you think about it at
all&mdash;just as Hollinger thinks&mdash;that I am a lucky and
none-too-scrupulous adventurer, <a name="page339"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 339</span>who had a fortune dropped into his
hands by a peculiar accident and have enjoyed its possession
undisturbed by any claimants up to this moment.&nbsp; But it
isn&rsquo;t quite like that.&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s rather more
drama in the true story of Krutzmacht&rsquo;s fortune than
anything we have yet offered at the People&rsquo;s
Theater!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took another cigar, remade the fire, and told Farson all
the details of his hunt for the vague Melody ever since he had
first found positive indications of her existence in the deserted
house above Monument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Latterly,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;Melody has grown
somewhat dim in my mind.&nbsp; Perhaps the theater has taken her
place as reality and as mistress; for I have always thought of
myself as doing it with her money!&nbsp; But to-night when that
woman turned up here with her vulgar, brazen air and tried to
hold me up in a blackmailing way, something made me feel that
Melody is still alive, in spite of all the chances that she
isn&rsquo;t, and that she will turn up in time to get her
own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will have to appear soon!&rdquo; Farson
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt in talking to Lorilla that she was perfectly
conscious she has no legal right to the money&mdash;knew all
along that Krutzmacht was married and had an heir or had made a
will&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page340"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
340</span>&ldquo;Did you ever get hold of that trunk, the one I
checked for you to Chicago when you were telephoning
Krutzmacht&rsquo;s office to inquire about Lorilla&rsquo;s
health?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It had disappeared before I was able to claim it.&nbsp;
I suppose it went in the unclaimed baggage sale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never&mdash;it was too soon.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s got
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe there was anything in it except
some ledgers and letter files that might interest the railroad
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps.&nbsp; But I doubt it.&nbsp; She would have
used it before this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The secretary seemed more concerned over the situation than
did Brainard.&nbsp; The latter said musingly as he dropped his
cigar into the ashes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, if there is no Melody, or if I can&rsquo;t
find her, which amounts to the same thing, that woman might as
well have the money as anybody else.&nbsp; At least, a reasonable
amount.&nbsp; Krutzmacht probably owed her liberal
compensation....&nbsp; But I shan&rsquo;t give up my belief in
Melody until the courts compel me to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that you would let that Walters
woman have the money?&rdquo; the younger man demanded in
astonishment.</p>
<p><a name="page341"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
341</span>&ldquo;Farson, you don&rsquo;t understand.&nbsp; I
suppose it seems absurd to you&mdash;it does to me at
times.&nbsp; But I have never for one moment considered myself
the owner of Krutzmacht&rsquo;s millions&mdash;never!&nbsp; I
suppose that has given me my freedom of action, my feeling that I
could do things like this theater,&mdash;not for myself.&nbsp; In
my own mind I was always acting for some one else.&nbsp; It may
be all imagination, but if it is, Melody just as an idea has
helped me tremendously,&mdash;to keep my hands clear, not to be
corrupted by the large sums of money at my disposal,&mdash;to
make a man of me!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a mighty helpful thing to be
in the position of trustee to some unknown person.&nbsp; It might
solve some of our hardest economic problems if more of our wealth
was held on the same terms.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t explain it all,
but it makes you free really not to have a cent of your
own!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farson murmured something that sounded like the term which
Hollinger had twice used, by way of contempt, in describing
Brainard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t understand!&rdquo; he sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;d better get to bed,&rdquo; Brainard
laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to worry about.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s one happy result of my attitude.&nbsp; If it will
make you feel any more sure of my sanity, I will see my lawyers
in the morning.&nbsp; They are not <a name="page342"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 342</span>likely to take sentimental views, I
can tell you.&nbsp; I have been too profitable a
client!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Farson had taken the hint and removed his bewildered
person from the room, Brainard sat for another hour before the
dead fire, in a sleepless revery.&nbsp; The unexpected visit of
the stenographer and the fight-trust man had brought back vividly
a long train of memories of what had constituted his active life
for the last four years.&nbsp; The situation that had developed
had again emphasized the dream quality of all living.&nbsp; It is
the conventionally expected in life that makes what men
ordinarily term reality.&nbsp; A slight turn from the ordinary
course of events produces a sense of unreality.&nbsp; For four
years there had come to Brainard, turn after turn, utterly
unexpected and unforeseen, each one producing this sense of the
essential unreality of life.&nbsp; But behind it all had grown
the living reality of his own will and character that had been
formed by meeting and dealing with the exigencies of each
situation fairly according to the laws of his nature.</p>
<p>As he had said to his secretary, the result was that he found
himself now ready to abandon his adventurous position upon demand
without a sense of overwhelming loss and disaster.&nbsp; He had
no more feeling of enmity or of contempt for <a
name="page343"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 343</span>Lorilla
Walters than Hollinger evinced.&nbsp; She was playing her little
part in the complex scheme of destiny, playing it vulgarly and
crudely, and he suspected improperly.&nbsp; But what occupied his
thoughts at this crisis, much more than the possible machinations
the actress might be able to set on foot against him or the
instability of his own fortunes, was the woman&rsquo;s
situation.&nbsp; What Hollinger had said for her in plea of
extenuation had touched him more deeply than he had let the
fight-trust man see.&nbsp; It was perfectly true that she should
be provided for out of Krutzmacht&rsquo;s loot in life.&nbsp; He
tried to think how this could be brought about without
compromising himself or his elusive mistress&rsquo;s
rights.&nbsp; He resolved on the morrow to see not only his
lawyers but Hollinger also, and contrive some plan by which the
ex-stenographer could obtain justice without gratifying her
spite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she is not the old man&rsquo;s heir&mdash;of that I
am sure!&rdquo; he said to himself as at last he sought his
bed.&nbsp; &ldquo;And Melody lives&mdash;I stick to that!&nbsp;
The dream will hold to the end, not go to pieces in any vulgar
fashion like this!&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page344"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
344</span>XIII</h3>
<p>The perfectly correct New York lawyers to whom Brainard told
his tale later that morning evinced no surprise.&nbsp; There was
nothing in the heart or brain of man, they seemed to say, that
could flutter a New York lawyer.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would be
advisable to find Miss Melody straightway,&rdquo; they felt, and
inquired what sort of title Brainard held to the Arizona
mine.&nbsp; When he confessed that it was only a tax title, they
remarked that under the Arizona laws any heirs of the dead German
had a year more in which to redeem the property.&nbsp; That did
not trouble Brainard.&nbsp; The lawyers very strongly urged their
client not to make advances to Miss Walters or to her friend and
manager on her behalf.&nbsp; That would be suicidal, they
averred, opening the way at once to endless blackmail and even
criminal prosecution.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let the matter rest until the
interested parties make some move,&rdquo; they advised, in a
perfectly cautious and obvious way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done my best to find the heirs, as you
people very well know.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m convinced there&rsquo;s
only one, and I&rsquo;m not sure that she has any legal <a
name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
345</span>claim.&nbsp; But hers was the only name the old man
mentioned the one time I saw him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly made a mistake in not getting hold of
that trunk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After my settlement in Paris with the bankers,&rdquo;
Brainard explained, &ldquo;I felt that it was of the first
importance to go to Monument as soon as possible; and by the time
I turned up at the Chicago railroad station, the trunk had
disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If no heir can be found, there is not much danger of
trouble; but if they should happen to get hold of this girl you
call Melody, it might be awkward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be only too glad if she could be found, by
them or any one else!&rdquo; Brainard exclaimed with
sincerity.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could then wash my hands of the whole
matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lawyer looked at him uncomprehendingly, then resumed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuming that no heir of the old man is forthcoming,
the only harm that these persons could do you would be to stir up
the attorney-general to take action to recover the lands for the
Territory.&nbsp; They would have to move quickly to get their
action before the courts, and the proper representations at
Washington would discourage any such litigation.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
346</span>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t worry me.&nbsp; But that
woman!&nbsp; She&rsquo;s perfectly capable of becoming
Krutzmacht&rsquo;s widow and providing a whole brood of
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean fraudulent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or left-handed,&rdquo; Brainard suggested.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I believe she&rsquo;s training them now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall have to wait until she produces them in court,
then,&rdquo; his counsel remarked with a grin.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>As the weeks and then the months slipped by without any sign
from Krutzmacht&rsquo;s former stenographer Brainard almost
forgot the midnight visit that she and the fight-trust magnate
had made and the disturbing conversation which had taken
place.&nbsp; During this summer the People&rsquo;s Company played
a short season in Chicago, and were so cordially received in that
city, which seemed to be more open-minded in theatrical matters
than New York, that Brainard felt he had made a mistake in not
starting his dramatic enterprise in this thoroughly American
community.&nbsp; An opportunity offering of securing the lease of
a new theater in Chicago, Brainard decided to take it and support
a second company in the West to interchange with the parent
company.&nbsp; He placed MacNaughton in charge of the new
company, having found a younger and more adaptable <a
name="page347"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 347</span>man to work
with him in New York.&nbsp; All these arrangements took much time
and thought and involved many trips between the two cities to
complete the negotiations.&nbsp; Brainard had the satisfaction of
knowing that if they had failed in their first season to make the
impression he had hoped, at least they had shown courage and
determination.&nbsp; The Idea was far from dead,&mdash;was
growing slowly and adapting itself, as all large Ideas must, to
the environment and the conditions. . . .</p>
<p>One morning, the day after his return from one of these
hurried journeys to Chicago, Brainard found Farson immersed as
usual in the folds of a newspaper over his coffee.&nbsp; Instead
of the customary greeting, the secretary handed over the paper
with the simple remark:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s struck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A front page story of the usual type, emanating from the
Pacific Coast, related that a woman claiming to be
Krutzmacht&rsquo;s lawful widow, married to him several years
before in a small southern California town, was about to
institute legal proceedings to recover the remnants of the dead
promoter&rsquo;s scattered fortune.&nbsp; At the time of
Krutzmacht&rsquo;s death, so the story ran, it was supposed that
his large fortune had been completely swallowed up in his
unsuccessful <a name="page348"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
348</span>enterprises, but recently through a series of
extraordinary events a very considerable amount of unsuspected
assets had been discovered, to which the widow now laid
claim.&nbsp; Eminent counsel had been retained in the case, and
sensational developments were promised, involving a capitalist
well known in New York and Arizona.</p>
<p>As Brainard having finished the story laid the newspaper down
with a slight smile, Farson observed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apparently. . . .&nbsp; It took her some time to get
into action.&nbsp; I suppose she was collecting her
properties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll produce a son in court lisping &lsquo;Pap
Krutz,&rsquo;&rdquo; the secretary growled.&nbsp; He could not
forgive Brainard for what he called his &ldquo;weak&rdquo; manner
of handling the affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we shall have an opportunity of seeing what sort of
story she can put up,&rdquo; Brainard remarked, proceeding
unconcernedly with his breakfast.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps this
action, through the notoriety it will give to Krutzmacht&rsquo;s
affairs, will serve to produce the real heir,&rdquo; he added
hopefully.</p>
<p>But after a visit to his lawyers Brainard was less
optimistic.&nbsp; They pointed out to him that undoubtedly the
first legal move would be to tie up the great Melody mine by an
injunction.&nbsp; <a name="page349"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
349</span>Whether the so-called widow could prove her marriage to
the satisfaction of the court or not, the mine must remain
idle.&nbsp; And the case might drag on for a couple of years or
more, depending upon the resources the widow could command.&nbsp;
During all this time there would be no income from the property;
instead it would greatly deteriorate.&nbsp; The lawyers&rsquo;
prediction was quickly fulfilled.&nbsp; Brainard found himself
without the large monthly income from the flow of the sulfur
wells, with an expensive law suit on his hands, and two greedy
theatrical companies to be provided for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As Hollinger warned me, Lorilla <i>is</i> a
Rattler,&rdquo; Brainard said to the secretary when the two went
over the situation.&nbsp; &ldquo;It looks very much, my boy, as
if this law suit would be the final curtain for the great
Idea.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m tied up short.&nbsp; The Chicago theater
has taken a lump of money.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe I could
lay my hands on fifty thousand dollars cash, all told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder where she is getting her money to fight the
case,&rdquo; Farson said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Hollinger is putting it up&mdash;as a promising
speculation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think he would do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&nbsp; It goes with his philosophy.&nbsp; He
gave me my chance to compromise&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page350"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
350</span>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;d only taken it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when he saw that I wouldn&rsquo;t compromise, he
might decide to play on the other side.&nbsp; It makes little
difference, anyway.&nbsp; If Miss Walters has any sort of claim,
she can easily get all the money she needs.&nbsp; There are
always &lsquo;eminent counsel&rsquo; ready to take that kind of
case on a good contingent fee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what will you do now?&rdquo; Farson asked in a
depressed tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First I must get rid of the lease of the Chicago
theater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad&mdash;the Chicago theater opened
well.&nbsp; Mac thinks it will almost make expenses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What Mac thinks and what the public thinks we have
found to be two different propositions,&rdquo; Brainard
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Chicago will miss us
much.&nbsp; But I hate to close the New York theater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you have to do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the figures&mdash;they don&rsquo;t
improve!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that dishes my play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farson had been hard at work during the summer on a play of
American life, based largely on material that Louisiana Delacourt
had contributed in a series of amusing confidences about her own
experiences, before her departure to <a name="page351"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 351</span>complete her education in
Europe.&nbsp; It was to be called <i>Her Great Adventure</i>, and
had been coming on very fast latterly.&nbsp; The plan between the
two friends had been to try it out toward the close of the
present season, and, if the play proved successful, to open with
it in the fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought about your play,&rdquo; Brainard
exclaimed sympathetically.&nbsp; &ldquo;We must keep the house
open until we can produce <i>Her Great Adventure</i>.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s money enough in the bank for that.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
patted his secretary affectionately on the back.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
finish it, my boy, as soon as you can.&nbsp; That place eats
money, and when the news leaks we shan&rsquo;t be able to keep
our company together long.&nbsp; Can you be ready by the first of
March?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will have to be ready!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s awfully good
of you, Brainard; and the play might possibly make money, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that happens, it will break all records for the
People&rsquo;s.&nbsp; We will give it every chance, anyway.&nbsp;
How shall we cast it?&nbsp; Will Clara Dudley do for the
girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forgetting all about Krutzmacht&rsquo;s new widow and their
financial predicament they began to discuss the cast for <i>Her
Great Adventure</i>.&nbsp; The leading character was a young
woman who had come fearlessly and pennilessly out of the great <a
name="page352"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 352</span>West, to
find a career in New York.&nbsp; Brainard remarked suddenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The woman to play that part is Louisiana
herself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Farson, for some reason, did not welcome
the suggestion strongly.&nbsp; He preferred to take his chances
with a more experienced actress.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where is Louisiana,
by the way?&nbsp; You haven&rsquo;t given me any news of her for
some time,&rdquo; Brainard asked.</p>
<p>Farson blushed slightly as he replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in London just now&mdash;having a great
time, I judge from the number of dashes and exclamations
scattered over her letters.&nbsp; Characteristic style, you
know.&nbsp; She hasn&rsquo;t taken down much of the original
bunting she carried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Brainard exclaimed with a
laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Louisiana is a genius.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t tell
her what&rsquo;s going to happen over here.&nbsp; Let her have
her little dance out as long as it is possible.&nbsp; Her hard
times, poor child, will begin soon enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She writes that Cissie Pyce is over there.&nbsp;
Remember Cissie&mdash;our first experiment as emotional
lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wept all over this carpet when I fired
her&mdash;<i>do</i> I remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Louisiana says that Cissie has been taken up by Bantam,
and is coming back to the States to play in <i>The Star of the
Seven Seas</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make somebody&rsquo;s fortune yet,&rdquo;
Brainard <a name="page353"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
353</span>commented, &ldquo;by discharging &rsquo;em, if in no
other way.&nbsp; But Louisiana was really our first and only
find&mdash;the one personality that we might have developed and
produced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she found us!&rdquo; the secretary corrected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what it has cost all told.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He ran over on his fingers the different large items of expense
that the great Idea had involved: &ldquo;The theater building
eight hundred, the first year in New York two hundred, Chicago .
. . one million six hundred thousand odd for Louisiana!&rdquo;
Brainard concluded whimsically.&nbsp; &ldquo;And she&rsquo;s not
yet launched.&nbsp; Our kind of art comes high, Ned!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a tip-top loser,&rdquo; the young man said
admiringly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever think what it will
mean to you, if Lorilla should win her suit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard stretched himself leisurely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except for being licked in this theater
business&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t like being beaten any better
than the next man&mdash;I should howl for joy when they produce
the fictitious widow and the orphan son in court.&nbsp; It would
set me free for another great adventure.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what
Herbert Krutzmacht and Melody have done for one Edgar
Brainard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his eyes was the azure glitter of the sky above the stern
Arizona mountains.&nbsp; For it was, indeed, a glorious world of
venture for him whose soul was keyed to the right pitch.</p>
<h3><a name="page354"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
354</span>XIV</h3>
<p>Nevertheless, Brainard felt depressed as the time drew near
when the doors of his theater would have to close, the windows be
boarded up.&nbsp; Even should he win the case against the
fraudulent claimants of the Melody, the great Idea could never be
wholly perfected in all the splendid details that he had
dreamed.&nbsp; No one man, were he Croesus incarnate, could
create a national art.&nbsp; He had learned that. . . .</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the first rehearsal of <i>Her Great
Adventure</i>, Brainard came early to the theater and waited in
the library.&nbsp; It was a pleasant place, he reflected, as his
eyes wandered over the empty room, with its polished marquetry
floor richly covered with rugs, and the charming empire
furniture, clocks, and ornaments that he had taken the pains to
place there.&nbsp; He had tried to make these public rooms as
clublike as possible, with ample lounging places, so that the
theater might be something of a home for the players, as well as
a workshop.&nbsp; Above the library was a glorified green room,
where simple meals were to <a name="page355"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 355</span>be had for a moderate price.&nbsp;
All these details were part of the Idea, as he had seen it.</p>
<p>The People&rsquo;s had a much better company this year, he
reflected,&mdash;no great talent, but all fairly competent, and
they worked together well.&nbsp; His enthusiasm and
Farson&rsquo;s had finally penetrated the ignorant and selfish
surface of theatrical nature.&nbsp; Mac had been tactfully
relegated to Chicago, and the promising young actor Leaventritt
was fast making a place for himself as manager.</p>
<p>The company was really getting into shape.&nbsp; Ignored as
they were by the critics and the &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo;
public, or ridiculed for their efforts, the People&rsquo;s
Theater had won the allegiance of its players.&nbsp; They were
developing a fine loyalty to the Idea, and a respect for
themselves as members of an institution that had not been founded
for profit.&nbsp; The week before, when Brainard had felt obliged
to tell the company of his financial difficulties, and of the
fate probably in store for the theater, there had been genuine,
unselfish concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your salaries will be paid until the close of the
season,&rdquo; he told them; &ldquo;and, in addition, each one
will receive the percentage of his pension earned by his length
of service.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there are no profits to share;
but of course I have assumed all losses.&nbsp; And now I want you
to do <a name="page356"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
356</span>your utmost for our last play&mdash;this piece by Mr.
Farson.&nbsp; Give it the very best you have in you.&nbsp; It is
a strong play, an American play, the sort of play for us to
produce.&nbsp; Let us end well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they had proceeded to the reading of the piece.&nbsp;
Afterward, many of the company had come to him to express
personally their honest disappointment at the enforced closing of
the People&rsquo;s Theater.&nbsp; They seemed to realize that
their loss was more than that of salary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll make <i>Her Great Adventure</i>
go!&rdquo; they all said.</p>
<p>The spirit of the players had been comforting to the
embarrassed patron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The People&rsquo;s might have won out in time, with
such a company&mdash;who knows?&rdquo; he mused to the
secretary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may win out yet!&rdquo; the young playwright
answered, with a certain touch of vanity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so, for your sake, I&rsquo;m sure; but one play,
no matter how successful, could not keep the Idea
afloat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the eve of failure, a new light had dawned in the
enthusiastic mind of the founder.&nbsp; He realized that whatever
one man tries to carry through alone, by brute force of will,
without regard for the sympathy and the help of others, is
destined to fail, especially where it is a matter of art that <a
name="page357"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 357</span>should
appeal to the many.&nbsp; Not Mrs. Donnie Pearmain and her
&ldquo;upper classes&rdquo; were needed, to be sure, but the
People; and the People&rsquo;s Theater had failed to touch the
People.&nbsp; Very likely, Brainard mused, Lorilla was the hand
of fate needed to prove this deeper truth to him.&nbsp; He had
failed to find his vanished mistress, Melody, and with her
inheritance he had tried to achieve the impossible.&nbsp; Now
that inheritance might be taken altogether out of his control,
and the great Idea vanish into the air from which his will had
conjured it. . . .</p>
<p>A page brought Brainard a letter with a foreign postmark just
as he was leaving the library for the theater.&nbsp; It was a
hasty little scribble from Miss Delacourt&mdash;one of the few
with which the young lady had favored him.&nbsp; In a hand that
galloped unevenly over the paper, she informed him:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming home&mdash;sail Saturday,
on the <i>Amerika</i>, with Cissie Pyce.&nbsp; Best wishes!</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;L. D.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brainard wondered what freak had possessed the youngster thus
to cut short her lark, as he went to the telephone to inquire
when the <i>Amerika</i> was due in New York.&nbsp; He determined
to say nothing to Farson of the girl&rsquo;s homecoming and to
meet the young woman at the dock himself.</p>
<p><a name="page358"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 358</span>There
might, after all, be some method in her insanity&mdash;and there
might be some good fortune in it for Farson and his play.&nbsp;
For the little neurasthenic Miss Dudley, who, to the most casual
eye, had evidently never been farther West than Hoboken, was
hardly the ideal of adventurous American womanhood that the
dramatist had drawn in his Gertrude.&nbsp; He would see Louisiana
first, and make up his mind whether she was safe to try before
speaking to Farson, whom he suspected of a more than friendly
liking for the young woman.</p>
<p>When Brainard returned to the auditorium he found a stranger
leaning over a rear seat, an unlighted cigar between his teeth,
apparently interested in the lines of the new play that
Leaventritt was going over with the company.&nbsp; As Brainard
approached, the man turned his head; it was Hollinger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he said, and nodding his head toward the
stage asked, &ldquo;New piece?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a few moments the two men listened to the halting lines
from the stage, then Brainard asked coldly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you want to see me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hollinger looked at him coolly, the merest smile on his
curving lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that is if you
aren&rsquo;t busy?&nbsp; <a name="page359"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 359</span>I was in New York and thought
I&rsquo;d look you up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard led the way to his private office, which was in the
front of the theater behind the library.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked shortly, closing the door
and standing above his visitor, who had seated himself and
crossed his knees comfortably.&nbsp; Hollinger&rsquo;s smile
deepened to a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you have something to say to me,&rdquo;
Brainard added impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing in particular,&rdquo; Hollinger replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I wanted to <i>see</i> you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to see how you take it for one thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard sat down in his chair more calmly and waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you made a mistake?&rdquo;
Hollinger inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind the&mdash;er&mdash;row?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to stop it all before it&rsquo;s
too late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard shook his head slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not <i>your</i> way,&rdquo; he said emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t suppose you would,&rdquo; the old
fight-trust magnate sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You knew I wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page360"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
360</span>&ldquo;Sometimes your kind come to their
senses&mdash;too late.&nbsp; I just thought I would sound you
again before the case came to trial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And save your money for counsel fees?&rdquo; Brainard
inquired suavely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that doesn&rsquo;t trouble me,&rdquo; Hollinger
replied lightly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You guessed that I was putting up
the money?&nbsp; How clever of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t yet bring myself to believe that you
mean to share with that woman in the profits of her perjury, if
she succeeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hollinger smoked a few moments before replying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind telling you that I have no intention
of taking a cent from Miss Walters, or Mrs. Krutzmacht, as I
suppose we ought to call the lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why do you go to all this trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For various reasons, my dear young man.&nbsp; For the
amusement I find in it for one thing.&nbsp; Can you understand
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With some difficulty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sort of sporting interest in seeing whether she can
win and carry off the bag, with the mine, from your hands, just
as the other time I was immensely interested in seeing you escape
from her hands at Jalapa. . . .&nbsp; She has a very pretty case,
a very pretty case,&rdquo; he mused.&nbsp; &ldquo;The best <a
name="page361"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 361</span>legal
talent have passed on it and found it quite flawless.&nbsp; It
ought to go through without a hitch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless the real heir should turn up
meanwhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You still stick to that romantic fiction&mdash;that
young man&rsquo;s fancy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said that you had other reasons for helping Miss
Walters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One other reason: I felt that you had treated
her&mdash;unsympathetically&mdash;oh, quite correctly from your
puritan point of view; morally you are always above reproach, my
young friend.&nbsp; But you are slightly inhuman.&nbsp; Your
attitude that night when we discussed this matter at your house
was both narrow and inhuman.&nbsp; It disgusted me, if you care
to know frankly what I thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in order to punish me for not following your advice
you are conniving with this woman in the perpetration of
fraud,&rdquo; Brainard sneered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You use words rather crudely,&rdquo; Hollinger replied
in a mild tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand
&lsquo;punish&rsquo; and &lsquo;fraud&rsquo; in the way you
do.&nbsp; You are determined to complicate a simple enough
situation, and I am determined to give your virtue an all-round
test. . . .&nbsp; Well, your mind is made up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely!&rdquo; Brainard exclaimed, rising to
terminate the interview.</p>
<p><a name="page362"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
362</span>&ldquo;Perhaps you have your own widow and
child?&rdquo; Hollinger suggested with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they went into the library, which the fight-trust man
looked at with much interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to see the house?&rdquo; Brainard asked
good-naturedly, always proud to show off his beloved theater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Above everything!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve read so much about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard conducted Hollinger over the building, explaining to
him his purposes in making it more than a mere auditorium with a
stage.&nbsp; Hollinger admired generously and intelligently all
that he saw.&nbsp; As they came out at last in the darkened
auditorium where the new play was still being read, he remarked
to his host:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very much obliged.&nbsp; It is all extremely
interesting, a kind of kindergarten for the drama.&nbsp; Is this
one of your products?&rdquo; he nodded towards the stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Farson&rsquo;s new play.&nbsp; We have high
hopes for it!&rdquo; Brainard said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, hurry up with it.&nbsp; I suppose you won&rsquo;t
be running theaters for amusement after&mdash;er&mdash;the
event?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That remains to be seen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you find that you want to get rid of this place, let
me know, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page363"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
363</span>&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might find a use for it. . . .&nbsp; I believe Miss
Walters has ambitions to be a real star with her own
theater.&nbsp; That is more <i>chic</i> these days than owning a
copper mine, and she will need occupation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that was another of your reasons for this
call?&rdquo; Brainard suggested with a laugh.</p>
<p>Hollinger smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She might take you on as manager&mdash;how would that
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll discuss it with her personally, when the
time comes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall advise her to let you manage the mine
instead!&rdquo; Hollinger retorted, after listening to another of
Farson&rsquo;s rather flamboyant periods.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think
she and I have better notions of what the &lsquo;People&rsquo;
like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a last smile he slowly sauntered towards the exit, where
he paused long enough to catch a few more of the speeches in
<i>Her Great Adventure</i>, which seemed to cause him
unhappiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lord!&rdquo; he murmured, and rushed for the
door.</p>
<h3><a name="page364"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
364</span>XV</h3>
<p>As the big, pot-bellied steamship was being slowly pushed into
her berth, Brainard, standing at the end of the pier, fancied
that he could recognize two little figures on the upper
deck.&nbsp; These feminine figures, rather eccentrically dressed,
were evidently the knot of a laughing, joking circle of American
men, all exhilarated by their approaching return to their beloved
city.&nbsp; When the great black hull threw its shadow over the
dock, one of the little figures waved both arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Louisiana, sure enough!&rdquo; Brainard
exclaimed, much relieved to know that the impulsive young woman
had not abandoned her home-coming at the last moment from some
fresh whim.</p>
<p>Ever since he had received her little note on the previous
Monday, he had been astonished at himself.&nbsp; The prospect of
seeing Louisiana again had often come into his mind with an
agreeable sensation, hopping in without reason, as if sure of a
welcome.&nbsp; This morning he had displayed a greater
nervousness at breakfast than he had <a name="page365"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 365</span>shown over the possible loss of the
Melody mine, and had reached the dock an hour too early.</p>
<p>All this anxiety he explained to himself on the score of his
desire to help on his secretary&rsquo;s play.&nbsp; From the
beginning Miss Dudley had shown such an inability to understand
her part, and to cope with the character of Gertrude, that the
young playwright was in despair.&nbsp; And yet Brainard&rsquo;s
interest in the maiden effort of his young secretary had not led
him to confide the news of Louisiana&rsquo;s unexpected
return.&nbsp; He had been gratified indeed to learn that the
young man did not suspect it.</p>
<p>Brainard wormed his way into the crowd at the foot of the
gangway and waited impatiently while the thin stream of
passengers filed down to the dock.&nbsp; The two actresses came
together.&nbsp; Louisiana reached out a thin little arm to grasp
Brainard&rsquo;s hand with a ringing &ldquo;Howdy!&rdquo; before
she gained the dock.</p>
<p>The European trip had made little surface change in the young
woman.&nbsp; She was hugging to her a variety of flowers, several
parcels, and a toy dog&mdash;a substitute for that shambling pup
with which she used to appear at the People&rsquo;s Theater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; she bubbled, as Brainard relieved her of
these impedimenta.&nbsp; &ldquo;A lot of trucky rubbish I
couldn&rsquo;t jam into my trunk nohow, <a
name="page366"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 366</span>though I
got a tub of a German steward to do the dead-weight act on the
lid.&nbsp; You see, I started from London on the run for the
steamer&mdash;didn&rsquo;t have time to pack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She glanced furtively at Brainard, then down the long
pier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This town looks good to me, even after Vienna and
Paris.&nbsp; Yes, I&rsquo;d like some real breakfast, thank
you!&nbsp; You must have camped out here all night to turn up at
such an hour.&nbsp; And how&rsquo;s everything?&nbsp; How&rsquo;s
the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voluble stream suddenly ceased, and her gray eyes rested
full on Brainard&rsquo;s face, as if even in her heedless mood
she hesitated to ask certain painful questions.&nbsp; Louisiana
was very pretty and quite smartly dressed, as Brainard noticed,
with a sense of satisfaction in the size of the letter of credit
that he had replenished generously from time to time during the
last year.&nbsp; Yes, in spite of her careless chatter, any one
could see that Miss Delacourt was something of a person now.</p>
<p>Her companion joined them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know Miss Pyce, of course,&rdquo; Louisiana
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Spell it with a <i>y</i>, please!&nbsp; We ran
bump into each other in Piccadill last week.&nbsp; Cissie had
engaged a deck stateroom all to herself, little swell, and
that&rsquo;s how I could get back on this boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why did you come in such a hurry?&rdquo; <a
name="page367"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 367</span>Brainard
asked, when Miss Pyce was diverted to the inspection of her
trunks.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought you were to stay over until the
fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louisiana looked softly up out of her gray eyes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But you see Cissie told me all about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Told you what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That your mine had gone dry, or something, and the
theater had to close, and you were in a hole
generally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that wouldn&rsquo;t have made any difference about
you&mdash;at least at present.&nbsp; I told Farson not to write
you of our troubles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; If it hadn&rsquo;t been for
Cissie, I shouldn&rsquo;t have known a thing, though she said it
was all in the papers.&nbsp; But I never read the papers over
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish Cissie had kept her mouth shut!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t, you know, if she had something
nasty about the People&rsquo;s to tell.&nbsp; But ain&rsquo;t you
the least bit glad to see me, after all my hustle to get here as
quick as I could?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I am awfully glad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally I couldn&rsquo;t stay over there, batting
around, and you folks in trouble&mdash;just couldn&rsquo;t have
swallowed a mouthful of food!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard held out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the nicest thing I have
heard for many a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page368"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
368</span>&ldquo;Perhaps I could do something to help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Brainard asked jokingly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Discover the real heir to the property?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Delacourt looked puzzled by this reference to his
predicament.&nbsp; Evidently Miss Pyce&rsquo;s information had
been only of the most general character.&nbsp; The details of the
threatened suit had not been considered of sufficient importance
by the news agencies to cable to Europe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can do something,&rdquo; the girl said, drawing
herself up haughtily.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no stage-struck kid
now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There <i>is</i> something you can do for me&mdash;for
us,&rdquo; Brainard hastened to say, remembering his chief excuse
for meeting her at the dock.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want you to come up
to my house for breakfast right away, and hear what it is.&nbsp;
Bring Miss Pyce, too, if she will come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;ll come!&nbsp; Cissie carries around a
trunkful of floppy airs, but she&rsquo;s a right good sort.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m going to stay with her until I strike a job.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s half promised to get me something in <i>The Star of
the Seven Seas</i>&mdash;kitchen wench, I fancy.&nbsp; Cissie
isn&rsquo;t giving much away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something better than that ready for
you.&nbsp; We want you to do the Gertrude in Ned&rsquo;s
play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the People&rsquo;s still open?&rdquo; she cried in
<a name="page369"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
369</span>astonishment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cissie said it had gone dead
broke, and was shut for good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is our last effort; and we want to go down waving
the flag.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s Farson&rsquo;s play&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know&mdash;he tried to put me in, but I bet he
didn&rsquo;t succeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good play, though!&nbsp; And Ned has
slaved for the theater these last two years.&nbsp; We must do our
best for him.&nbsp; Has he written you about the play?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; I should say he had&mdash;lots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The calm, impersonal way in which she admitted her
correspondence with the young secretary pleased Brainard
unreasonably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be there for luncheon; so speak to your
friend, and let&rsquo;s be off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Pyce condescended to accept the invitation to breakfast
from the proprietor of the People&rsquo;s Theater, as she had
nothing better to do with her time.&nbsp; Her own manager had
wounded her vanity by not appearing at the dock with an
automobile.&nbsp; So the three were soon tucked into
Brainard&rsquo;s motor and crossing the ferry.&nbsp; Miss Pyce
inquired after the fate of the People&rsquo;s company in a tone
of lofty kindness, until Louisiana kicked her about the ankles,
causing her to relapse into a sulky gloom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The salubrious air of Broadway will do you <a
name="page370"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 370</span>good, I
hope, Cissie,&rdquo; Louisiana remarked severely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve stood your nonsense for six days because I had
to.&nbsp; Now come to, please!&nbsp; Just because you&rsquo;ve
got a fool play, and a fool manager to waste his money on you,
you needn&rsquo;t try the Duse-Bernhardt-Ellen Terry pose on old
friends!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Pyce promptly descended several steps and began to
converse about the New York weather, which she said was trying to
English nerves.</p>
<p>When they arrived at Brainard&rsquo;s house, they found that
Farson had not yet come in from rehearsal.&nbsp; The two women
were shown into the little den behind the library, while Brainard
glanced over his mail.</p>
<p>Five minutes had scarcely elapsed when a shriek came from the
inner room, and the door was thrown violently open.&nbsp;
Louisiana stood on the threshold, clasping against her breast a
little picture framed in a thin gold molding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get <i>this</i>?&rdquo; she demanded
breathlessly.</p>
<p>Brainard looked at her admiringly.&nbsp; As she stood there
against the dark shadows of the inner room, the sun from the
window falling in a great gold bar across her auburn hair and
violet-colored traveling dress&mdash;thin, erect, full of the
passionate eagerness of youth&mdash;he saw Farson&rsquo;s
character created.</p>
<p><a name="page371"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
371</span>&ldquo;Bravo, Gertrude!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, where did you find <i>this</i>?&rdquo; she
insisted impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you got there?&rdquo; he asked, taking the
picture from her hands.</p>
<p>Her face followed his with curiosity and expectation, her eyes
searching him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get it?&rdquo; she repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This water color?&nbsp; I picked it up in
Arizona&mdash;out there where my mine is located.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a long story&mdash;<i>my</i> story.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
tell it to you some of these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&nbsp; Tell it to me now!&rdquo; she insisted, with
something more than childish impetuosity.</p>
<p>But just then Cissie Pyce, patting the marvelous folds of her
hair, came from the inner room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; Brainard replied, looking meaningly at
Miss Pyce.</p>
<p>Taking the water color from Louisiana&rsquo;s reluctant hands,
he replaced it above the desk in his private study, where it had
always hung since he had moved into this house.</p>
<p>Farson came in presently, and in the flurry of his surprise
and greetings the subject of the water color was apparently
forgotten.&nbsp; Now and again, however, during their lively
breakfast, Brainard found Louisiana&rsquo;s gray eyes resting on
him with a peculiar intentness.&nbsp; She did not seem so much <a
name="page372"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 372</span>excited
over the prospect of playing Gertrude in <i>Her Great
Adventure</i> as he had expected.</p>
<p>After the meal Cissie tore herself away reluctantly, and the
three others went over the new play, the author explaining some
of his ideas, and seeking to get the young actress interested in
her part.&nbsp; Louisiana listened, but evidently her thoughts
were far away.&nbsp; Farson was visibly disappointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Miss Delacourt must be tired after her journey
and the early landing,&rdquo; Brainard interposed in kindly
fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course&mdash;pardon me!&rdquo; the young dramatist
said, throwing down his manuscript.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me set you
down at your hotel on the way to the theater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you are already late for the rehearsal.&nbsp; I
will take Miss Delacourt home when the motor comes back.&nbsp; I
have something to say to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farson left with reluctance, after making an engagement for
the morrow with the young actress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll know my lines by that time,&rdquo; she
promised him.</p>
<p>No sooner had the door closed upon the secretary than she
leaped to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for the story!&nbsp; And may I see the picture
again?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page373"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
373</span>Brainard fetched the little water color and placed it
in her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I told you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s by way
of being the story of my own life&mdash;at least, of the only
part that counts as life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; she said expectantly.</p>
<p>Looking over her shoulders, he pointed to a spot in the
distant mountain background of the sketch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In there is the site of the great Melody
mine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Melody&mdash;what?&nbsp; Why, what do you mean?&rdquo;
the girl stammered in renewed excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Melody mine&mdash;that&rsquo;s the name of the mine
about which there is the litigation, you know.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
where all the money for the theater came from.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
the famous pot of gold&mdash;my Aladdin&rsquo;s lamp&mdash;only
it&rsquo;s likely to change owners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why did you call it Melody?&rdquo; Louisiana
demanded, with glistening eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all in the story, too,&rdquo; laughed
Brainard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then tell it to me&mdash;<i>all</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dropped the picture into her lap, and, holding her little
hands tightly clasped, fastened her eyes on Brainard&rsquo;s
face, as if what he had to say was of momentous interest to
her.&nbsp; But that, he reflected, somewhat flattered, was just
Louisiana&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here goes, then, Miss Delacourt, for the story <a
name="page374"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 374</span>of my life,
which explains that water-color sketch being in my
possession!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Brainard retold the tale of <i>his</i> great adventure
since he played the part of good Samaritan to the dying
stranger.&nbsp; It took some time to tell the story, and he did
not hurry.&nbsp; The motor came back and waited below, while he
went into all the details of the story with which we are
familiar.</p>
<p>At certain places Louisiana opened her lips, as if she could
not control an exclamation; but when Brainard paused, she merely
motioned him impatiently to continue.&nbsp; As he told of his
dropping from the train at the lonely water tank, and of the
strange little girl who had guided him to Gunnison&rsquo;s shack,
Louisiana&rsquo;s mobile lips parted in a curious smile.&nbsp;
She was not so much interested in his Mexican adventures, nor in
the European chapters, but when he described his first visit to
the deserted house on the hill above Monument, the girl&rsquo;s
face sobered to a wistful expression, and she caught her breath
as if she might sob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there I missed her by a few weeks!&rdquo; Brainard
said.</p>
<p>Louisiana laughed aloud, as if it were all a joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds,&rdquo; Brainard remarked, having rapidly
concluded the account of his experiences as a miner, &ldquo;like
a dime-novel yarn, but it happens to be all <a
name="page375"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 375</span>true.&nbsp;
And throughout my adventures, all through these six years,
I&rsquo;ve clung to the idea of just being the trustee for this
unknown lady&mdash;this Miss Melody Krutzmacht, or whatever her
real name may be.&nbsp; I think that is what has saved me from
becoming a plain gambler, and the whole business no better than
the melodrama Farson and I saw, <i>The Stolen Bonds</i>, where we
met my old friend Hollinger.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got Melody to thank
for saving my moral character, as well as doing a lot else for
me.&nbsp; But I haven&rsquo;t much hope now of finding the lady,
to thank her for anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She ought to have something to thank <i>you</i> for, I
should say!&rdquo; Miss Delacourt exclaimed warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not.&nbsp; I really feel in my bones
that those crooks will beat me out of the property, unless a
miracle comes along.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been a poor sort of steward
while I had charge of the money.&nbsp; I put every cent I
squeezed out of the bankers into developing the mine, and saved
myself by a fluke with the sulfur wells.&nbsp; Then all the money
they brought in I&rsquo;ve sunk in this theater game, without
much to show for it, as you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you keep a few dollars for
yourself?&rdquo; Louisiana inquired with childish directness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there are a few thousands lying
around&mdash;enough, young lady, to have kept you going in <a
name="page376"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 376</span>Europe
another year, and to put on this play of Farson&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
That wipes the slate clean, and I must pawn these duds to stake
myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe this play will make money,&rdquo; the actress
suggested thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be the miracle, then!&rdquo; Brainard
exclaimed whimsically.&nbsp; &ldquo;It will be a greater miracle
than the one that made me into a millionaire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe in Mr. Farson&rsquo;s
play?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course!&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t believe in our luck,
nor in the people&rsquo;s taste in drama, as I once
did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl sat staring at the little picture, clutching its
frame with her hands.&nbsp; After a time she looked up into
Brainard&rsquo;s face with a winning expression about her small
mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you give me this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would give you pretty much anything else I
have,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, you see, that sketch
is all I have of Melody&mdash;supposing it was hers!&nbsp; You
understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a good deal of feeling for this
Melody?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Brainard admitted, slightly reddening, and
added more lightly, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been my benefactress, you
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl raised her gray eyes and looked <a
name="page377"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 377</span>steadfastly
at him.&nbsp; Her face was older, Brainard suddenly perceived,
than he had remembered it.&nbsp; Yes, the trip abroad had done
much for the wild young girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want <i>this</i>!&rdquo; she insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you shall have it!&rdquo; Brainard exclaimed
impulsively, and added with another blush, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
about all that I can give you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it&mdash;and that&rsquo;s why I want it so
much!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that there was a conscious silence between them, until
Miss Delacourt rose to leave.&nbsp; She walked slowly to the
door, as if loath to go; then she turned and reached out both
hands to Brainard.&nbsp; He took them, and they stood facing each
other mutely.</p>
<p>For the first time in all these years his loyalty to his
unknown mistress completely vanished.&nbsp; The ideal of Melody
had faded from his mind.</p>
<h3><a name="page378"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
378</span>XVI</h3>
<p>If the young dramatist had been disappointed by Miss
Delacourt&rsquo;s apparent lack of interest in his play and in
the part of Gertrude on the occasion of that first luncheon, he
was quickly reassured by the energetic way in which, beginning
with the next day, she threw herself into her work.&nbsp; As soon
as she had time &ldquo;to roll up her sleeves,&rdquo; as she
expressed it, she plunged into the rehearsals, an incarnation of
work and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>To be sure, she put the author through some uncomfortable
hours while she criticized his piece and suggested many important
changes with her usual frankness and point.&nbsp; She
&ldquo;combed it out,&rdquo; as she said, line by line, and
convinced him, against his will, that he should cut freely and
sharpen his dialogue all through.&nbsp; Moreover, she set him
right on several subtle points in the heroine&rsquo;s
psychology.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She knows what she&rsquo;s about, too,&rdquo; Farson
reported to Brainard.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how
she&rsquo;s done it, but in her flip way she&rsquo;s absorbed a
lot in Europe.&nbsp; She knows what all of them are doing.&nbsp;
She was quoting Brieux, Barrie, and Shaw at me <a
name="page379"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 379</span>last night
all in one gulp.&nbsp; I must rewrite that third curtain to suit
her ladyship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must remember that you are dealing with a
star,&rdquo; Brainard observed dryly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Louisiana may
be new to the firmament, but she knows instinctively what belongs
to her starship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In much the same manner the new leading lady took hold of the
other players, and &ldquo;shook &rsquo;em all by the neck and
woke &rsquo;em up.&rdquo;&nbsp; There were but three weeks left,
and she wore the company almost to the point of revolt by the
long rehearsals she demanded.&nbsp; When they grumbled, she read
them a characteristic lecture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your last stunt for the old
People&rsquo;s.&nbsp; You know you have all got a lot out of the
concern&mdash;for one thing, better pay than some of you will
ever see again; and much more besides.&nbsp; So show that
you&rsquo;ve got something warm inside your anatomy where your
hearts ought to be&mdash;at least a dog&rsquo;s gratitude for the
hand that&rsquo;s fed you.&nbsp; The piece is all right, too; it
will make the jaded pulse of Broadway flutter like an
<i>ing&eacute;nue</i>.&nbsp; Just you give the public a chance to
discover that here is a play as <i>is</i> a play!&rdquo;</p>
<p>During these strenuous weeks of rehearsal Brainard was absent
most of the time in Arizona and Washington, where the already
celebrated case of the Krutzmacht widow was now imminent.&nbsp;
<a name="page380"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 380</span>He had
come to believe that Farson had more than a professional interest
in his Gertrude, and he preferred to be absent from the scene of
the wooing; but on the day of the dress rehearsal of <i>Her Great
Adventure</i> he returned to New York and dropped in at the
theater on his way home, slipping into a seat in the rear of the
dim house.</p>
<p>The piece went with amazing swiftness and smoothness, thanks
to the hard work Miss Delacourt had got out of the company.&nbsp;
Absorbed by the play, Brainard was completely taken out of the
wearying round of his daily perplexities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> a play,&rdquo; he muttered excitedly to
himself, &ldquo;and they do it wonderfully well.&nbsp; That girl
is almost great.&nbsp; If the public will only come to see her,
and not believe what the newspapers say, they&rsquo;ll
understand.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s an actress!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He repeated these warm words of praise a little later in Miss
Delacourt&rsquo;s dressing room, where he went to congratulate
the actress.&nbsp; Louisiana was in street costume, buttoning up
her gloves, when he arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw you in the back row,&rdquo; she said in
reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Any better news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid not.&nbsp; The first court reserved its
decision.&nbsp; They put up an amazing case, the impudent
rascals!&nbsp; They almost made me believe them in spite of
myself.&nbsp; I must tell you all <a name="page381"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 381</span>about it sometime.&nbsp; I think we
shall be able to pull off <i>Her Great Adventure</i> just in time
before the sheriff closes the doors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed good-humoredly at the situation, and handed her his
cigarette case.&nbsp; Louisiana lighted a cigarette, then said
abruptly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t be angry with me.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve borrowed something of yours while you were away.&nbsp;
Couldn&rsquo;t wait to get permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honored that you found anything worth taking!&nbsp;
What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I borrowed a new name for myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember you said that we had ruined the old one for
you!&rdquo; he laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You were sitting over there
in the corner, too mad to cry, when you said it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After making such a guy of myself as Cordelia I
couldn&rsquo;t bear to see the old name on the billboards.&nbsp;
Besides, I think I like this one better, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m calling myself Melody&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard&rsquo;s expression changed suddenly; and he turned
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; she said
coaxingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a pretty name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Melody what?&rdquo; he asked with a touch of
sternness.</p>
<p><a name="page382"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
382</span>&ldquo;Oh, just Melody White&mdash;that&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Melody was <i>her</i> name,&rdquo; he
protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know!&nbsp; You told me so.&nbsp; But that Melody
doesn&rsquo;t exist really; she&rsquo;s just a name&mdash;an idea
you have.&nbsp; I took a fancy to it&mdash;my dotty point,
see?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m superstitious about it.&nbsp; I want to make
this play a great big success, as you made the mine,&rdquo; she
said swiftly.&nbsp; &ldquo;So don&rsquo;t be cross with me for
making free with your unknown lady love&rsquo;s first
name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard smiled in spite of himself at the girl&rsquo;s
insistence on a trivial thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I should object,&rdquo; he said
slowly.</p>
<p>But he realized that even in speaking he did object.&nbsp; It
was one thing to ask him for Melody&rsquo;s sketch, the only
memento he had of his mistress, but another to take this liberty
with the mythical Melody&rsquo;s name, and to post it up for the
whole world to see on a theatrical billboard.&nbsp; In a moment,
however, Brainard&rsquo;s common sense came back to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t take
that name as well as any other, if you can make it right with
Farson and the manager.&nbsp; I should think they might object,
after all the press work they have done for Louisiana
Delacourt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can manage <i>them</i> all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page383"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 383</span>The
new Melody puffed these gentlemen aside in a cloud of smoke.</p>
<p>They drove uptown together in Brainard&rsquo;s car, but
neither spoke.&nbsp; The girl, Brainard observed, was unwontedly
excited, her little hands gnawing at the muff in her lap, her
keen eyes devouring the passing crowd on the streets.&nbsp;
Brainard, who was tired in mind and body, was content merely to
watch his companion from his corner through half-closed eyes.</p>
<p>After all the hard work of the past weeks, Louisiana&mdash;or,
as she now preferred to call herself, Melody&mdash;was
marvelously fresh and pretty.&nbsp; She had the lithe body, the
deep-set eyes, the sensitive, mobile features of a real
temperament.&nbsp; He wondered whether she cared deeply for
Farson.&nbsp; The young secretary was undoubtedly attractive, and
should this play bring him the attention it ought, he might
become a good dramatist; but if the girl had an ambition to be a
great actress, she had better not tie herself yet to any
man.&nbsp; And it comforted Brainard curiously to remember how
unmercifully she had handled the young man&rsquo;s play.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The Star of the Seven Seas</i> is to be
withdrawn,&rdquo; she said at last, breaking in on his
meditation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only two weeks&rsquo; run&mdash;dead
failure!&nbsp; Cissie thinks New York audiences are exceedingly
<a name="page384"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
384</span>provincial.&nbsp; She is going back to dear old Lunnon
as soon as she can get there.&nbsp; Maybe I shall be able to help
her later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the car stopped before a third-rate hotel in the Forties,
Brainard inquired:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Cissie has moved from the Astor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Cissie is visiting me now,&rdquo; the actress
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Times change&mdash;for us all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do that&mdash;sure&mdash;and for the better
sometimes!&rdquo; the young actress averred with a contented
smile.</p>
<h3><a name="page385"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
385</span>XVII</h3>
<p>Latterly the critics had completely ignored the existence of
the People&rsquo;s Theater.&nbsp; Its announcements aroused no
more public interest than the program of an ethical culture
society.&nbsp; Brainard, who had at last learned the real
importance of publicity, feared lest this same contemptuous
indifference on the part of the press might bury his young
secretary&rsquo;s play in hasty and undeserved oblivion.</p>
<p>But as he sank into his seat on the following Monday night he
was surprised and relieved at the size and the character of the
audience.&nbsp; All the leading critics of the metropolitan press
were there, also many of &ldquo;those who know,&rdquo; and whose
verdict is useful indirectly.&nbsp; There were some theatrical
people, and a few fashionable folk from Mrs. Donnie
Pearmain&rsquo;s world.&nbsp; The rest were of the ordinary,
semi-intelligent theater-going sort.</p>
<p>It was an ideal house before which to try out the new
piece.&nbsp; If the play had anything enduring in it, there were
those present who could recognize the fact.&nbsp; Ned Farson had
many personal friends <a name="page386"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 386</span>in the city&mdash;college mates at
various clubs, young literary aspirants, dramatists, newspaper
and professional men.&nbsp; Among these, evidently, the word had
been passed around that Ned&rsquo;s play was to be
produced&mdash;and that was enough.&nbsp; Louisiana had also
worked Cissie, and Cissie Pyce had reached other professional
circles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now for the play,&rdquo; Brainard sighed, dropping
his glasses after this preliminary reconnaissance, &ldquo;and for
our one actress!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last, in the hush of a well-trained, expectant audience,
the heavy curtains drew apart noiselessly, revealing the first
scene&mdash;a rough shack in a mining camp, with a splendid
background of mountains and desert.</p>
<p>There was no doubt from the first curtain that the piece would
go&mdash;would hold this audience, any audience, by the simple
power of its story, its honest pathos and humor, its vitality and
veracity.&nbsp; But it was not until the first scene of the third
act that the people gathered there awoke to the fact that a real
actress, and one whose very name had not been heard before that
night, was taking this piece, and the part of the Western girl,
Gertrude, to present herself as an artist.&nbsp; &ldquo;Melody
White&rdquo; was her name on the program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; was the whisper that ran around the
theater.</p>
<p><a name="page387"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
387</span>Certainly she was not the Louisiana Delacourt whose
liberties with Cordelia had made a farce of Lear!&nbsp; Quiet,
almost subdued in her methods, with an extraordinary variety of
power, she gave the lines&mdash;many of which had a real poetic
quality&mdash;with a musical accent that swept over the ears of
the audience like a soft, summer wave.&nbsp; Her face was lighted
with a glow; her slightest gesture seemed to reveal something of
the character&mdash;the free, fearless, capable woman of the
great West.</p>
<p>As the play went on, hardened theatergoers looked at one
another in wonder and joy.&nbsp; Here, beyond the shadow of
doubt, was a fresh talent, as Brainard had predicted.</p>
<p>At the close of the act, after the furious applause, the
flowers, and the curtain calls for company, actress, and author,
there was a clamor behind the scenes for a speech from the
founder.&nbsp; The company gathered about Brainard and insisted
that he &ldquo;must say something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talked to &rsquo;em when I was down, do you
remember?&rdquo; Melody remarked.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think you ought
to say a word now that I am up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So for the second and last time Brainard faced an audience in
the People&rsquo;s Theater, and the irrepressible young actress
was the occasion for both his speeches.&nbsp; In a few rapid
words he <a name="page388"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
388</span>reviewed the purposes he had had in mind in opening the
theater, two years before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have made many mistakes, of course.&nbsp; Perhaps
some of you may think that we have made more mistakes than
anything else.&nbsp; We have learned a great deal; and first of
all, that in our country there is no
&lsquo;people&rsquo;&mdash;no <i>one</i> public.&nbsp; At least,
they haven&rsquo;t patronized their own theater!&nbsp; But I
can&rsquo;t think that we have altogether failed, after such a
night as this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of our desires was to produce truthful American
plays of American life.&nbsp; <i>Her Great Adventure</i> is
American to the core, and you seem to think it good.&nbsp;
Another object was to discover and educate persons of unusual
dramatic talent, to create artists and free them from the base
compromises of the commercial stage.&nbsp; To-night you have
witnessed the d&eacute;but of such a talent.&nbsp; Having given
the world <i>Her Great Adventure</i> and Miss Melody White, who
shall say that we have failed? . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the play, the company gathered in the library for
supper, to celebrate their triumph.&nbsp; It was Brainard&rsquo;s
custom to give such a feast at every premiere, but to-night there
was among the fifty or sixty guests an unaccustomed air of
success and intoxication that bubbled into speeches and songs and
kept them until long after midnight.&nbsp; At last, after dreary
failures, contempt, and <a name="page389"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 389</span>neglect, the People&rsquo;s had
achieved a real, big, popular success!&nbsp; The critics had
scattered to tell all New York to go to the People&rsquo;s
Theater in West Twelfth Street, to see <i>Her Great Adventure</i>
and a real American actress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shan&rsquo;t be closing right off, I reckon,&rdquo;
Miss White whispered across the table to Brainard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as soon as I expected!&rdquo; he replied with a
smile.</p>
<p>When the party finally broke up, he looked to see the
successful author lead away his triumphant star; but, to his
surprise, Farson went off with some young men, to finish his
triumph with them at a club.&nbsp; Brainard questioned the
actress with his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;ve got to take me home in your
car!&nbsp; Cissie has left.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you see that I have
waited until all the women are gone, and now you are making me
ask you for a ride outright?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I merely wished to efface myself before the hero of the
occasion,&rdquo; he replied joyfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need of such consideration.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s left me
to cab it up alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you already had the usual tiff between two
collaborators?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; she drawled, as the car started with
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not at all!&nbsp; But you see, he wanted to
push the contract.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page390"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
390</span>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ned asked me yesterday to marry him.&nbsp; It would be
a convenient arrangement, you know; he could write the plays and
I make &rsquo;em famous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put it that way!&rdquo; Brainard protested
quickly.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the best of fellows, and I know
that he cares for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t hurt him, I reckon.&nbsp; Clever
boy&mdash;my, how big his head will be after to-night,
though!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young actress yawned, and snuggled under the fur robe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just happy.&nbsp; You see, I was right.&nbsp;
The play is going to be a great money-maker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly looks that way to-night That means that we
shall be able to keep the theater open till the end of the
season, and close with the band playing.&nbsp; For all of which
we have to thank you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your clever secretary!&nbsp; Tell me, have you
heard anything more about the case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lawyers telephoned me late this afternoon that the
judge had given his decree&mdash;in <i>their</i>
favor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her hand stole across to his under the robe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, we appeal,&rdquo; Brainard went on; <a
name="page391"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 391</span>&ldquo;but
they&rsquo;ve got a strong case.&nbsp; Fraud, of course, but we
can&rsquo;t prove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&nbsp; Tell me more about the case.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve been meaning to ask you all along; but this play has
filled every corner of my little head.&nbsp; Now I can think of
something else.&nbsp; Come on upstairs.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t feel
the least bit sleepy, and you can tell me all about your
case&mdash;why they won when it&rsquo;s a fraud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s simple enough,&rdquo; Brainard began, when
they had seated themselves in the actress&rsquo;s tiny
parlor.&nbsp; &ldquo;This man Krutzmacht, it seems, had married
his stenographer out there in San Francisco.&nbsp; At least,
she&rsquo;s got a perfectly good certificate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how could he have really married her, if he was
already married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean if he was already married to the lost
Melody&rsquo;s mother?&nbsp; But <i>was</i> he married to her
mother?&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t find any record of it.&nbsp; Nobody
knows, unless we could find Melody herself, and I have given up
all hope of that.&nbsp; Krutzmacht might have deceived her, too,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course he <i>was</i> married to Melody&rsquo;s
mother&mdash;and wasn&rsquo;t divorced, either!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stupid!&rdquo; she said gently, rising and putting <a
name="page392"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 392</span>her hands
on his shoulders.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see that&mdash;I
am Melody&mdash;yes, the real Melody!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Louisiana&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name of my mother&rsquo;s State.&nbsp; I made up
Delacourt for the stage.&nbsp; Louisiana Delacourt was to be my
stage name but Cordelia spoiled it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed at his astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are Melody Krutzmacht?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, no!&nbsp; Melody White.&nbsp; Krutzmacht
wasn&rsquo;t any father of mine, thank goodness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was Mrs. Della White&mdash;legally married to Herbert
Krutzmacht in the American consulate at Guatemala City.&nbsp; He
met mama down there, and married her, when I was a child, and
adopted me, too.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got everything necessary to
prove what I say.&nbsp; So you just telegraph that judge to hold
his horses and get ready to write another decree!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they hadn&rsquo;t been divorced?&rdquo; Brainard
pursued, bewildered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that!&nbsp; He was bad enough, gave mother a
dreadful life, took her up to that desolate mining town in
Arizona, and left her there.&nbsp; Poor ma!&nbsp; But he sent her
money when he had any&mdash;even that last time when he was in
New York&mdash;and always called her his wife.&nbsp; I have
letters to show it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page393"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
393</span>&ldquo;But you weren&rsquo;t his child!&rdquo; Brainard
mused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only by adoption; but I am my mother&rsquo;s only
living relative, and she died <i>after</i> him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, as the old man seems to have had no other living
heirs to make claim, it is all your money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Melody shook her head smilingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite that!&nbsp; A good part of it must belong to
my able trustee, who discovered the sulfur and made it pay.&nbsp;
Dad Krutzmacht couldn&rsquo;t have had very much to the good when
he died.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t a nice sort of man, Dad
Krutzmacht,&rdquo; she added thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he left you a nice little fortune&mdash;something
that should run into the millions.&nbsp; You will have to think
more tenderly of the old fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&nbsp; How I hated him and Monument!&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s why I dropped his name.&nbsp; And just as soon as
mother was gone, I fled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the night&mdash;rode down to the railroad.&nbsp; I
remember it all.&nbsp; But tell me, where did you go then, and
what happened to you?&nbsp; How did you escape the search I made
for you all over the world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s <i>my</i> story!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell it
to you some day&mdash;how I dishwashed and cooked on a ranch for
a living, peddled corsets, and worked in a
factory&mdash;it&rsquo;s a long yarn.&nbsp; Some of it is in the
<a name="page394"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 394</span>play; I
told Ned the amusing things.&nbsp; But he has fixed it up a whole
lot&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been hard for a girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was, but I am not sorry.&nbsp; It gave you a chance
to work the mine, for one thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause, and then Brainard rose to leave,
saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Miss White&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just plain Melody, please!&nbsp; I like the
name&mdash;don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means a good deal to me, as I told you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl blushed, remembering what Brainard had said about his
unknown mistress, and drawled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t like my taking it a little
bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Brainard admitted.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I
don&rsquo;t mind now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You oughtn&rsquo;t to, really, seeing that it is my own
name by baptism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They both laughed at this.&nbsp; Melody danced about the small
room, woke up the new Boston bull, and made him dance with
her.&nbsp; She was once more the child Brainard had first known
at the opening of the theater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to squelch that woman who&rsquo;s
trying to take poor mama&rsquo;s place,&rdquo; she remarked, in a
pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I shall attend to that at once&mdash;<a
name="page395"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 395</span>and all
other business until I can straighten out your property and hand
it over to you clear of tangles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&nbsp; Do you think I am going to take
your old mine?&rdquo; Melody fairly shouted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s yours, yours, all yours!&nbsp; You won the
first stake with your nerve, and you made the rest of it.&nbsp;
And you&rsquo;ll keep it, too, my friend&mdash;at least, most of
it.&nbsp; Perhaps some day, when I get the fool-bug in my head,
and want a company of my own, I&rsquo;ll come around and call on
you for a couple of hundred thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard looked at the girl almost severely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the property is <i>yours</i>, of course.&nbsp;
Krutzmacht meant it so.&nbsp; Your name was the last word on his
lips.&nbsp; I have been merely your guardian.&nbsp; It would be
impossible for me to keep it now.&nbsp; You can see that it would
be entirely different from what it has been while you were only a
name to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what <i>you</i> are,&rdquo; she replied
slowly.&nbsp; &ldquo;The honestest, most generous, most unselfish
of men&mdash;and the foolishest!&nbsp; Come, let&rsquo;s stop
this swapping of compliments like a couple of
children&mdash;&lsquo;You take it, George!&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;No, you take it, Edith!&rsquo; . . .&nbsp; So old Pap
Krutz wanted me to have his money when he was dying!&nbsp; I
suppose he thought to make it square for what he <a
name="page396"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 396</span>put mother
and me through.&nbsp; He treated us like <i>peons</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may think differently about your millions in the
morning.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll wait till then.&nbsp; Good night, and
double congratulations, Melody!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;d quite forgotten how good I was in the
play.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll send you those papers about mother
to-morrow morning, and you see that the scalawags don&rsquo;t
make good!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t be bothered with law suits and
things until after the season closes.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m making
<i>my</i> great adventure now, the same as you did once!&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t want to be disturbed until I have carried it
through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see that you are not disturbed.&nbsp; Before
I go, please tell me why you didn&rsquo;t let me know the truth
when you found that picture in my room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had my idea,&rdquo; Melody replied vaguely, her eyes
shining into his.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have given it
away now&mdash;not until I had really made good&mdash;if it
hadn&rsquo;t been for that woman winning the law suit.&nbsp; When
I discovered what the trouble was, I had to tell, of
course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I almost wish you hadn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Brainard
exclaimed, starting for the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page397"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
397</span>&ldquo;I think you can tell why!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he was gone, leaving Melody with a thoughtful smile on her
pretty face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; she remarked after a time, as in
rapid, unstarlike haste she divested herself of her clothes,
&ldquo;that I shall find a way of compelling him to keep the
money&mdash;somehow or other!&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page398"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
398</span>XVIII</h3>
<p>As he had promised, Brainard attended to the business affairs
of Melody&rsquo;s estate.&nbsp; The lawyers easily obtained a
stay of proceedings and a retrial.&nbsp; With the proof of
Krutzmacht&rsquo;s real marriage to the mother of the young
actress, the case dropped like a cracked egg, before it got to
court.&nbsp; Hollinger and the counsel, who had been
&ldquo;staking&rdquo; Miss Walters in her attempt, foresaw
dangerous consequences and withdrew precipitately from the
case.&nbsp; After the smoke had cleared away, Brainard did not
forget the plea that Hollinger had made in behalf of
Krutzmacht&rsquo;s former stenographer.&nbsp; He resolved to use
whatever influence he might have with the new heiress to secure
for Lorilla Walters a modest crumb from the rich cake she had
fought for that would make her independent for life and allow her
to withdraw permanently from the stage.&nbsp; The last that
Brainard heard of the versatile fight-trust magnate he was
employed in the capacity of financial adviser to a Chinese
prince, who had conceived the idea of developing a railroad in
his province with the aid of Western capital.&nbsp; <a
name="page399"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 399</span>Hollinger,
whose headquarters were generally in London, achieved a signal
success in this kind of financial diplomacy for which his
temperament and his morals both fitted him.</p>
<p>After the suit had been disposed of, Brainard amused himself
by preparing an elaborate report of his trusteeship of the
estate, in which everything was accounted for, to the original
items he had spent on his first journey.&nbsp; He also put his
own affairs in order, in preparation for that day at the close of
the theatrical season when the young actress would deign to give
her attention to business matters.&nbsp; She was too busy at
present.</p>
<p>For the improbable had really happened.&nbsp; <i>Her Great
Adventure</i> proved to be the one undoubted theatrical success
of the past four seasons.&nbsp; That intelligent first-night
audience had gone home and told its friends that they must not
miss the new play at the queer theater in West Twelfth
Street.&nbsp; They, in turn, had promptly told their friends, and
the news had quickly become contagious.&nbsp; Instead of a two
weeks&rsquo; run the house sold out until the end of June, and a
road company was already being prepared to satisfy the curiosity
of the provinces.&nbsp; Incredible fact!&nbsp; The People&rsquo;s
Theater was making money, even with its low scale of prices.</p>
<p>At the close of the fourth week, when the new <a
name="page400"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 400</span>manager
came to see Brainard in regard to the next season, Brainard
smiled at him in amusement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m out of the theater business,
Leaventritt.&nbsp; The place isn&rsquo;t mine any
longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw that you had won your suit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but the theater isn&rsquo;t mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sold out?&rdquo; the manager asked, a disgusted look on
his eager face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that, but I&rsquo;m out of it, just the same.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll have to see Miss White about another season.&nbsp;
Perhaps she can help you out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And just when the blamed sucker had fallen into the
mint, so to speak!&rdquo; the manager complained to a
subordinate.&nbsp; &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s up to Miss Melody White,
is it?&nbsp; Well, that lady&rsquo;s no sucker.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
have to show her good cause!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The next day, as Brainard was superintending the dismantling
of his rooms, word was brought to him that Miss White had called
and wished to speak to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it isn&rsquo;t Mr. Farson that Miss White wishes
to see?&rdquo; he asked the servant, thinking of the new play
which Farson had begun for the actress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; a laughing voice answered
from the hall, and Melody pushed her head through <a
name="page401"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 401</span>the
doorway.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re pulling out?&rdquo; she asked
in surprise, remarking the disheveled condition of the pleasant
library.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know yet&mdash;just stripping for
action,&rdquo; Brainard replied buoyantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
gather a lot of moss about you whenever you plant
yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp; He pointed to the books and pictures
ranged along the walls, ready for the packing-cases.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And one sinks into the moss, too, so that it becomes hard
to tear up,&rdquo; he said less cheerfully.</p>
<p>Melody sat down on a lounge, crossed her knees, and slowly
pulled off her long gloves, as if she had come to stay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My!&rdquo; Brainard remarked, looking attentively at
her clothes, &ldquo;how dressy the lady is getting to
be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marks of my position,&rdquo; Melody replied, with
elaborate indifference.&nbsp; &ldquo;It makes Cissie&rsquo;s eyes
water when the things come home.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s almost as good
fun as telling her that I will try to save her a small part in
the new play, or something in one of the road
companies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you paid Cissie in full for all her
airs?&nbsp; Or do you still get amusement out of teasing the poor
thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One has to do something, you know,&rdquo; Melody
sighed.</p>
<p><a name="page402"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
402</span>&ldquo;The <i>ennui</i> of success has come so
soon!&rdquo; Brainard mocked.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be taking
to &rsquo;citis and lap dogs.&nbsp; But I have a document that
may distract your starship&rsquo;s idle moments meanwhile, and
give you something to think about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stepped into the inner room and returned with a typed
manuscript.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another play?&rdquo; Melody inquired in a languid
tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you taken to writing plays,
too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; Brainard replied, running over the
sheets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leaventritt came to see me yesterday,&rdquo; Melody
remarked carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sent him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to be careful.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a mercenary
streak in his blood, and success is likely to bring it out; but
he&rsquo;s intelligent and honest enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still set on making an idiot of yourself
about the money and things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you mean that I am still determined to render unto
Melody the riches that are Melody&rsquo;s by rights, why,
yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any one of a number of things,&rdquo; Brainard replied
cheerfully.&nbsp; While Melody negligently turned over the pages
of his elaborate report, he continued musingly: &ldquo;It was
just six years <a name="page403"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
403</span>ago this month when my play was turned down&mdash;the
last one I ever wrote.&nbsp; I walked back up the avenue with the
manuscript in my pocket, feeling that the bottom of the world had
dropped out.&nbsp; I was a forlorn, broken specimen.&nbsp; It was
a day something like this, too.&rdquo;&nbsp; He glanced at the
lowering April sky.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is very different now.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not much richer than I was then, but I am a totally
different being.&nbsp; In fact, I think now I could call myself a
man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; Melody agreed, in a rather doleful
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a man can always face the world with a light heart,
no matter how light his pockets happen to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Melody nodded sympathetically, and murmured,&mdash;&ldquo;for
the great adventure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&nbsp; Life is the great adventure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a long silence, Melody looked up into Brainard&rsquo;s
face and stretched out her hands to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you take me&mdash;with you&mdash;on the
great adventure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brainard grasped her hands, and, leaning forward, tried to
read the full purpose in the gray eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Melody!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must I ask twice?&rdquo; she said, blushing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s <a name="page404"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
404</span>more than most women have the nerve to do once.&nbsp;
You see, after you left that night, I
guessed&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Brainard took her in his arms she threw back her head, and,
holding him away, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll have to take the Melody mine along
with Melody.&nbsp; I said I&rsquo;d make you keep the old
thing!&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page405"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
405</span>XIX</h3>
<p>&ldquo;And what shall we do with the theater?&rdquo; Brainard
asked, in a lucid interval, early in June.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shall we
sell it to Einstein &amp; Flukeheimer for vaudeville?&nbsp; Or
shall we keep it for a certain American actress when she wearies
of matrimony?&nbsp; Or shall we try to put new life into the
great Idea, and keep on giving the dear Public what bores it,
because it&rsquo;s good for the dear Public to be
bored?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought much of your great Idea,&rdquo; Melody
confessed candidly.&nbsp; &ldquo;The trouble with it is that it
doesn&rsquo;t do any good to give people what they aren&rsquo;t
willing to work for.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got to earn your bread,
so to speak, in order to digest it properly.&nbsp; The
Public&rsquo;s got to want good plays and good acting enough to
pay the proper price for &rsquo;em.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t get
people interested in an art they don&rsquo;t understand and
don&rsquo;t want enough to work for.&nbsp; Let &rsquo;em give
themselves the best they can understand and like until they kick
for better!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That even I have begun to comprehend, O Minerva and
Melody in one!&nbsp; Still, there are <a name="page406"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 406</span>exceptions to your philosophical
principle&mdash;for example, yourself, goddess, and me, who
digest with an excellent appetite our heaven-sent
cake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you earn it&mdash;and me?&nbsp; As few men
ever earned the love they take!&nbsp; And I reckon I earned you,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There followed an unlucid interval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what, then,&rdquo; Brainard resumed, after the
interval, &ldquo;shall we do with one large, commodious theater
building; also one great Idea with a hole punched in it, through
which the gas has escaped?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking of that problem, too.&nbsp; We
might turn it into a co&ouml;perative company, and let the
players own it and run it to suit themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even into the ground?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just that!&nbsp; But there are some good heads in the
company, and it will give them all a chance.&nbsp; Besides, we
can afford it, dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we can much better afford to give it away than to
keep it running,&rdquo; Brainard admitted.&nbsp; &ldquo;As your
husband, I can&rsquo;t countenance all the follies I put on you
as mere guardian!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the last night of the season, a warm June night, the
People&rsquo;s players got together at the close of the
performance in the pleasant library of the theater, and Brainard
and Melody made them <a name="page407"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 407</span>two little speeches.&nbsp; First,
Brainard explained to the players the plan of a co&ouml;perative
stock company, in which all members were to own shares, with a
board of directors, of which Leaventritt was to be chairman and
Farson secretary.&nbsp; Then Melody said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard the boss on the new plan.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re
in great luck, let me tell you!&nbsp; And you will be awful
chumps if you fight among yourselves, or otherwise don&rsquo;t
make a go of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Melody looked severely at Cissie
Pyce, who was seated obscurely in the rear of the room.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Of course, you&rsquo;ll all think yourselves Coquelins and
Sarahs.&nbsp; Well, you&rsquo;re not.&nbsp; Mind what the manager
says.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got the prettiest, nicest theater in the
city, a fair company, and a good start with Mr. Farson&rsquo;s
new play.&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t be with you next season.&nbsp; As
you&rsquo;ve doubtless heard, I&rsquo;ve taken a new
manager&mdash;for life&mdash;and we&rsquo;re going abroad on our
first tour.&nbsp; So buck up!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t fight!&nbsp; Good
luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thus was formed the independent Company of Actors, with
one Edgar Brainard as honorary president, and Mrs. Edgar
Brainard, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Melody White, as honorary vice
president.&nbsp; All the company came to the wedding, and later
trooped to the dock to see the couple depart for Europe.</p>
<p>A floral offering from the company&mdash;an <a
name="page408"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 408</span>elegant
version of the great scene in Farson&rsquo;s play, done in roses
and carnations&mdash;filled their stateroom to the exclusion of
much else.&nbsp; It was labeled, &ldquo;Their Great
Adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Melody said when they went
to inspect their quarters.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s life, not
art!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made a fair start, don&rsquo;t you
think?&rdquo; Brainard added.</p>
<p>Melody replied by raising her lips for the expected kiss.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
